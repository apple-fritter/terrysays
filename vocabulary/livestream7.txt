so I could publish this on my website or
that's kind of a what's the word
unnatural the flow like publishing
waiting publishing waiting it's kind of
fucked up so instead I'm just gonna go
I'm just gonna go like just talk to God
what the hell let's use the temple it's
a sacred space this is a prayer the
prayer shrine you ever seen a prayer
shrine the shrine is kind of a place to
pray I guess how about that prayer yeah
let's see you ever seen a prayers right
which don't
that's something like uh whatever maybe
got a chaired some place to pray around
some shit like that
so what the hell that's a prayer shrink
God said to remove my veil it looks good
for you to have the fucking let's give
you a little bit of heat no fuck it
looks cute if you'd had the hood on fuck
it's fucking cold
I can hit to heat but then I fucking cut
I don't be a pussy it's not Tibet
[Music]
you know you don't even have to save it
it's kind of um I used to get bogged
down with you know it's like it's like
it's like raw unedited content and I
used to make it buy them by the bushel
and what do you do with it you just end
up with page after page and you know
it's like awesome shit but like who
cares manners anyway what do you you
know sometimes there's no like a monk a
monk sometimes they take a vow of
silence you know I don't know maybe this
is not the reason but it's something to
consider if you promise God that you're
not gonna reveal the truths of the
universe maybe he will tell you them and
that's an interesting thing to wonder
about a vow of silence and you promise
me he won't tell anybody
no okay fuck you wait
sure so if you type view it basically
throws away this enters this enters a
state machine where it it it doesn't
process the the command-line it goes
into a state I just watch this let's
just look at this footer
the code is the documentation for temple
OS so if you know how to program you
know immediately what this does it gets
a character is it escape or shift escape
no then it keeps looping so it's waiting
first game or shift escape and fuck it
that's the documentation right there so
the documentation in temple OS is right
it's a comp you put the comment in the
function header and so forth so like I
told you man
computers went to hell once he made them
for niggers so like fuck it if you're
using temple OS did have you ever seen
the uh have you seen the user's guide
for the Commodore you're gonna laugh
your ass off you think I'm joking right
you're thinking that's ridiculous you
expect people to program have you see am
i right you're going home well getting
computer has to be like that like are
you kidding like how on earth could you
expect people to know that do you think
I'm joking you're like are you crazy
and check this shit out this is the
users guide what does it teach in here
if for look at that shit this thing was
made to fuck around with programming
isn't that funny this thing was made to
fuck around with programming and
eventually their people started buying
it for the games eventually the people
started mining for the games but in the
original take this shit out on the
Commodore they the users guide that
every single users got taught how to
make graphics with binary numbers look
at that shit so this was the
entertainment this was the entertainment
so what I've done
is I've made a in the spirit of the
Commodore user programming is more
important than third party I've even I
could try and ban third party I guess
that that would keep it simple we don't
want to uh if you start getting
professional companies making games then
like suddenly everybody's motivation is
gone you know that's what happened on
the Commodore the first couple years
there weren't any cool games and like
everybody was happy making their their
amateur games but eventually there were
cool games and then nobody liked the
amateurs stuff and there were there were
two uh you know uh why would I make an
amateur game you know and the only thing
that changed was they were intimidated
by the the presence of professional
games do you think I'm joking go look up
b-1 bomber and then f-15 strike eagle
look at this when I first got my
Commodore check this shit out when I
first got my Commodore you want to know
when I first got my Commodore one of the
games we had was b-1 bomber c64 it's the
80s height of the Cold War honest to god
this was the this was a game honest to
god this was a game it's like you're
looking at an instrument panel with no
graphics and you run around and you
change the altitude shit like this this
was a fucking game
a game that is this amateur is something
that a teenager can aspire to create a
teenager looks like this and he says I
could do that and then eventually you
know I told you I uh this was when
general Davey was at Luke Air Force Base
um and I got to ask general Davey
we got to ask him if this was up what he
thought of the Commodore 64 f-15
simulator
so I got to ask the general of the
training base Luke during the height of
the Cold War just if if it I got to ask
him at this game how he how it was
compared to the real thing
and you know what's he supposed to say
that oh yeah that's good or you know
something like that what could he say
you know I'm saying it's kind of
you know what that's a badass sound they
made that sound pretty well you know how
you do that shit you gotta like combine
together frequencies and waveforms and
stuff
to get a home that's cool
so I I did an HD audio driver with 44
different waveforms
eventually I realized
that there's not just one HD audio
driver that would work basically it's
like the bunch - woman
and then eventually God said you wanted
just one voice and so
this was Libya Libya was the target
remember I did drop it either further
drop it on Qaddafi that was a that was a
song that date the the Phoenix band was
particularly it went it was the local
disc jockey made a song about dropping
it on Qaddafi and it went national
so I didn't know fucking my screen was
fucked up didn't even give any fucks
fuck
I did a flight simulator I did a flight
simulator um um I used pretty simple I
sorta zomp I was sort of lazy how do I
put this
I sort of purposely used easy techniques
but then I was forced to uh to work a
little bit to get the I had to draw a
horizon line in flood-fill
and actually it was a it was just it was
a little bit of work to calculate the
where the horizon line intersects the
the left right top bottom there's a
little bit of work this is kind of
tricky right so you start with the you
start with three angles right roll pitch
and or no height this role in pitch if
you start with the roll in pitch try to
calculate the intersection with the with
the borders and then do a flood fill you
know it's like it's just algebra but it
it's a lot of work anyway
it's painful it's tedious anyway so
girl right arm fuck my fucking shoulder
hurts I can't fucking type fuck
don't have an ashtray
some motherfucker stole it either
I used to color it in red but now I
don't give any I don't give any fucks so
you can see there pray to God all you
are and talk with him and shit if your
question is entertaining it counts as an
offering
like I figure he likes original
questions if you ask him shit he doesn't
want to answer fuck you
so like this keyboard is is the laptop
and it requires an extra key so it kind
of fucks everything up so my passage
thing doesn't work so I can go swap that
but that fucking sucks
[Music]
the f-111 is what my dad worked on its
the sweep swiping
you
you
so I guess if a birds flying in let's
just say uh attic maybe it well it
doesn't mean they can follow the air
currents around tree trees or something
I don't know I wouldn't go
so you think that's what caused
echolocation beams avoiding they were
worried about whirlpools in the air and
so they started developing echolocation
was that what you're saying
the evolution of echolocation Rick
so you have to take a vow of silence I'm
just kidding
so
so there's that right if you get bored
you can talk to God but it takes a lot
of work because you gotta like carry on
conversation it's a lot more fun doing
other shit
I like to have in comment on stuff while
I browse the web I like to read stuff on
the web
find interesting stuff and then talk
about it like just having comment just
to have him comment but you're not
supposed to consult em unless you do an
offering you'll get in trouble if you
piss him off or whatever he said it's a
it's a mortal sin like communion
preparation unworthy damn my shoulders
foot
I guess I'm really tired
whatever you were about to do just
became whatever you're about to do after
you get coffee nothing comes before
coffee that's why we're introducing a
new line of cafe quality espresso drinks
from a cafe in small peppermint mocha
for just two dollars like can you run
down to the kitchen and your underpants
in the middle of the night if you're
hungry I mean I could I I don't you
