okay
so I'm gonna do some sim structure
basically I learned how to make PID
controllers we'll talk about what a PID
controller is so this program I wrote
back in 2000 and it was pretty cool at
the time so I wrote this program mm what
do you want to make how about a nuclear
submarine
well anyway
so you can you can make a submarine a
kid made a submarine I had some some
people sent me scenarios that they had
created we can only get a couple these
were sent in but somebody made a this is
pretty cool so somebody made this I
think you press 1 & 2
[Music]
let's start over then you break them and
then you separate a stage I think you
have to try and land
you're supposed to land it so anyway
somebody made this with sim structure
which is the program that I wrote
submarine some how old is this person
age 13 nathan age 13 made this let's
zoom in oh it has a torpedo
oh it has okay so you can inflate the
submarine so I made this program back in
now it flows up somebody sent in the
model of the solar system my numeric
integrator is probably pretty impressive
it can do the solar system so if you
zoom in he did the earth I'm gonna track
oh sure
what did I do oh shit don't do that
yeah I'm going to track that earth okay
so now we zoom in moon is spinning
around the earth so X it's actually
if you tried to set up a solar system it
takes a long time for them to settle
into an orbit something like that it's
not easy doing it like if you just make
a mass and we can give it a vector
velocity vector oops I thought I pleased
to do mass let's get out of here for
this anyway I'm hurry
also they mean that charge particles
you you make the charge attractor or
repelled you have to repel so the the
the color represents the charge they
made a video game where you have to
repel I'm pressing keys by the way in
order to make these programs do stuff so
someone who made a rocket surfer so we
can do it you wanted to a control system
on this puppy
so this some kid some kid made this with
sim structure
I'm not sure I like the what he does
with his hands is pretty funny okay so
you want let's make a controller for
this puppy so Phillip so T one touch
thrust equals let's say T 1 dot
saturation times
oh let's uh what we want is if he falls
over if he falls backward that means cut
the throttle if he falls back cut the
throttle if he doesn't fall back
increase the throttle so uh put labels
what is what is this bond shit
let's say bond 18
so our angle is going to be fund 18
heading I made the mistake of doing this
in degrees just that
I took wrap and unwrapped is supposed to
unwind a an angle and place it in a
certain anyway
let's do Engel okay so let's display the
angle first of all okay so
hey holy shit
okay so the angle is 25 15 14 so zero is
all the way back so we want 90 okay so
so the angle I think we want to take -
pi / - why is it positive both
directions am being an idiot okay so
it's between okay so
oh we want to multiply this with you
let's take five times the Engel
okay that's
okay so we made a controller for
faceplant so somebody made a hoverboard
you want to turn this into a hoverboard
you know what do if you're if you're
doing it by yourself you can fly what
I'm gonna do it manually so watch this
so this thing will fly if you do it
right but we have to make
how about we make a controller what is
the time
t equals four is when it launches so
yeah T less than four else I'm gonna do
a separate controller for time after
four let's do angle one this will be
easy so we just do two angles angle one
is for one word and we want this to be
let's see what happens
so Engel to
let's let's - let's subtract so this is
uh let's let's go 45 degrees how about
that
so we're not doing PID controllers yet
we could do PID
we want it the other direction
what I meant to say is we want what I
see
what the hell am i doing we're going
around the zero point
there we go I did it
[Applause]
this
let's put a grid okay
so I made a hoverboard if you want to
make him fly at a certain elevation this
is a y equals five how about let's let's
put it at y equals ten what is the
particle for his head P 6 P 6 equals 20
or 15 how about P 6 equals 15 plus 15
minus P 6 del Y now we can we can give a
coefficient for this
let's say 20
okay if he ever starts bending forward
we don't we don't want him to bend
forward so we're gonna increase that
okay more we want more of the first less
of the second
okay
lesson two second
okay let's reduce his elevation see if
we can stay at ten
these are increments of five I do
believe so peace sakes is that kid
do you want to try for a more exact how
about if
how about if
10 - p6 doubt why absolute value
let's increase this to five
[Music]
yeah hello yeah it is who's this
Secret Service okay no we're gonna do
we're going to take this put it here
little we aren't going to how about we
want / this how about 10 divided by 1 +
