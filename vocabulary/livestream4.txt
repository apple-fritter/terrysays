okay so back to the front so hum
you know Dilbert and I don't really like
Dilbert I used to like Dilbert but now I
see it as populist leftism it's Marxist
Dilbert is Marxist the boss is stupid
you know I kept hoping that I would that
the comics actually were making the boss
smart and the people stupid why do I
like Gilbert what why do I just like
Dilbert
it's a lot harder to be a manager than
an employee
so like for example I don't like it it's
fucking leftist I can't believe I used
to I sort of liked it you know I went on
a and went on a trip to a job interview
and in the parking lot someone had an
license plate Dilbert and they asked me
if I liked it I was like shrug you know
what do you answer I mean I don't know
anyway so the thing that annoys me is
its own it's just a low-level kind of
humor instead of I kept hoping I loved
it sometimes you can sort of see
unintentional where the boss is smart
and Dilbert is stupid that's what I keep
hoping for I was like let's go see some
Gilbert well anyway so um so the other
day it's hard to keep your head on
straight
so and originally I put these numbers
because I had a problem identifying if I
saw if it caused that if there was a
glitch I couldn't tell where it was in
the sequence so I put these numbers and
these numbers were a pain in the ass
because you have to read number them and
so I made this if you do ctrl T this is
a I did I don't like to show off what
does it L Li yes what the fuck is that
fuck okay so left macro we create a
variable variable then we count through
steps and then we we do we do a search
for TS we search for TS and then we
start doing some cursor right cursor
right delete anyway then we do some
deletes and stuff like that so this is a
I didn't want to do do you want to see
what it does well so it renumber x' all
the numbers it searches for TS so it's
kind of cool I'm not proud of I didn't
want to use it okay so let's go ahead
and modify it to you on delete the the
numbers I'm getting rid of the numbers
because I have obviously
when I started I was lazy I didn't want
to put all the strings but in the end I
I put all the strings so it's kind of uh
can we modify this or this just do it
fuck this okay you know we're gonna do
okay so Dilbert the manager you don't
want to sleepwalk okay
so ctrl F let's see here's what we do we
say F to record there's 73 of them right
so um ctrl F yes right right right so
you can when you make a macro it will
reproduce it for you I'll show you show
you that in a second
okay so we just deleted so we stop the
macro I don't know if you have to press
stop and now let's put 172 of them
getting exact and then repeat n times oh
fuck
the fuck
oh it did it oh damn I thought it was so
it so it worked
however it
it froze the why is that da why is that
teacher there the fuck
oh that's fine okay why didn't you use a
global variable huh
too proud to use a global variable okay
that's fine okay so um too proud to use
a global variable okay oh fuck oh we
used to have them I have to make a
global variable fuck you fucking fuck I
just I think we used to have a global
variable so the reason we can't use the
progress global variable is because um
some applications will clobber the
progress bars so we have to recreate
them every time okay so why not you want
to use a static look no again he's just
daddy there used to be a start-up 40s
okay
so we want to say testsuite
- sweet fuck
so we just got rid of I
this wheat I plus plus oh you know let's
use a global variable just wheat what
are you why did I do that why the fuck
did I do that
okay so now are you serious I can't
believe I had to fucking do that okay
this week t0 this week
okay so Gilbert
being a bosses
okay so here's what we do you say if to
record
and we say
f3
okay so now we say we want to play up
172 times so this part I don't have
preemption and so it freezes Oh didn't
freeze okay
okay so
sometimes I like to imagine that my
operating system will be used for 2,000
years into the future and that each of
these characters is important because it
will be uploaded and transferred okay
I think I had
sometimes it's weird why the fuck did I
have that t0 I think it's just because I
didn't want to use a global variable
fuck
what
one seven seven six
so um you might ask why am i doing these
test Suites um you know quite honestly
the more you run it the better my
operating system is fucking rock-solid
the only way to get that is to
aggressively chase bugs actually I
shouldn't say that you know if I
interrupted in the middle of this
there's a chance that would cause some
corruption okay I don't try to I don't
try to make my operating system fail
what do I mean I don't I don't do things
in the background and interrupt them and
do stuff I kind of treat my operating
system with kid gloves well that's kind
of ironic anyway anyway uh so
maybe I need to spend some time being
for being a brutal user interrupting it
and doing shit you know the reason that
I don't is because uh we're not we're
not trying to make it Titanic we're
trying to make a kayak
you know what kayak is designed to be
reinstalled I can reinstall in five
minutes so
nevertheless
I know
some things are off limits when it comes
to our what I expect out of my operating
system you know I let Linux is a semi
truck with 20 gears if you think about
file permissions and stuff Windows is a
passenger car in Temple os is a
motorcycle so with the motorcycle if you
lean over on a motorcycle it will crash
anyway
should I put tap in here anyway so that
macro that I used to have here renumber
was a good sometimes you want
demonstrations or examples it served as
a a pretty good
I think I'm gonna regret this
it served as a pretty good
you know I have to make demonstrations
of features and stuff that renumber
macro is pretty slick but it's better if
you don't need it obviously so I was
lazy I didn't want to type all those
strings in the beginning
so when you're the manager
a young engineer is likely to uh not
keep it simple
an old engineer keeps it simple
and
so I kind of
I don't like Dilbert I keep hoping that
I'm going to be impressed with like
really clever comics where the manager
is actually the smart one
Dilbert would be a lot better if the
manager was actually the smart one in
that that would be an awesome comic if
they did that they don't do that right
when I was well obviously when I was
young I didn't quite understand
clever
anyway they should have made Dilbert the
smart one very I mean the boss is Marwan
know
let's go look at some Dilbert Cummings
let's see how long it takes to find one
where the boss is unintentionally the
smart one I found a couple where the
some people might
some people might be disgusted Terry you
know why you liked the boss because
you're a loser no I'm actually an
awesome engineer
so
if I had a job I guess I would be the
pointy hair boss wouldn't I
that's who I would be if I had a job
there would be some punk some punk who
keep it fucking and simple fucking
nigger I'm not impressed
yes I would be the point of your boss
so let's go see how long it takes to
find an example where the boss is
actually the smart one
this is working out better than I
thought so I was going to use the I have
the ability to use the ican unassembled
code I thought I could do something
tricky
I didn't want to put those those strings
I was going to use the caller and then
do some unassembled but then I realized
I didn't have the unassembled doesn't
have the strings in in this case the
unassembled doesn't have the strings if
you see these files already see this do
main compiler if we put the call to TS
inside of this function then we could we
could that's that's another option we
could put the call to TS inside this
function and then we could use the the
unassembled and what would we see when
we unassembled the caller the caller's
name would be mini compiler and then we
can get to string so if we put the TS
into the function but anyway as you can
see um where you what if we used the in
this TS file we could extract the string
and set TS so there i wanted to get
clever i could anyway
but I think we set off for this
I already fucking typed I already
fucking typed all the strings it's not
too bad making a new entry you know how
many
how often how many more examples are we
going to add probably not too many I
need to uh what I want is I probably put
some work into cult
I need to cull that's my favorite word I
need to cause some some redundant
examples oh I know it's going to say so
there's a steer at Syracuse the Catholic
book in the Bible right and Sirach is a
Catholic only book and they have a
there is a form of shrewdness which is
thoroughly bitter I think that's the
greatest quote there is a form of
shrewdness which is thorough thoroughly
bitter
and keep it simple is bitter deleting
work that you've already done is bitter
there is a form of shrewdness
it's just thoroughly bitter so I can
swear it so I got the Surat I have a
this is a Catholic Bible I don't have
the King James I like the King James
because it says Oracle
so
I used to do random I don't use that
Bible very often I do all my stuff
online with the King James but some of
the pet some of the passages stuck with
me there is a form of shrewd you know
what the best line is it is not for a
man buckling his armor to boast as
though he were taking it off it is not
for the man that is the most badass it's
not for the man buckling his armor to
boast as though he were taking it off I
can't believe that's that's the most
badass fuckin I can't believe that's not
in a movie it's not for the men buckling
his armor to boast as though he were
taking it off
so
so running the test suite is not a waste
of time because that's what it's for
do you see you see how it never caused
it you see how you never get any bugs
when you run it and it's because I ran
it a lot
there is a form of shrewdness that is
thoroughly bitter so let's go look at
some Gilbert comics
okay escape so
that was can the cargo cult this was
cargo cult why do you have the number
and the reason I had the number is
because when it was running in it
crashed I had a hard time finding
finding which which it was oh and we
don't want cargo cult
and
we don't want cargo cult
and
I like to
I like to be brief
if he can say it in
and I think I get off on I get off on
short choppy B Metallica so I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be a Dilbert boss when do you
write beat Metallica so what do I mean
by B Metallica let me show you when you
in everything you do
payment be Metallica what I mean I mean
look at some of these they they talk in
short how do you describe it short sharp
words you know Trump is uses simple
words what's a good example
they use vivid bodies fill the fields I
see hunger euros and no one to play
soldier now no one to pretend running
blind through killing fields bred to
kill them all
victim of what said should be a servant
until I fall soldier boy made of clay
now an empty show twenty one holy son
but he served us well bred to kill not
to care you see I don't do eggs bred to
kill you know what these are short sharp
powerful sentences not to care - just as
we say finish here greetings death he's
yours to take away back to the front
Bheema delegate you won't understand
until you're older so it doesn't do any
good okay so let's go up should I put
that in my policy so now I'm a manager
okay
user
when you write a song
so we're gonna do exercises where you
have to write songs because it teaches
it teaches you something
Beeman delica you know what when I was
young I used to write paragraph or big
long emails like a page of tedious text
and a manager would look at it for a
second and then do it one sentence
answer for sentence fragment answer I
was like dude I wrote you a whole page
of beautiful grammar sentences and you
give me this sentence fragment answer
what the fuck so
let's go look at Dilbert let's go see
how long does it take to find one where
the boss is the smart one yeah I found a
couple dude you should totally do that
now I sort of despise these
whoa
so I'm gonna be the pointy-haired boss
that's my new
I think stuff like this is hopeless you
can't just tell them being Metallica's
let's gonna get some ramen delegate
no I don't even know that's all
fortunately I know this song
I think he's Irish
do I know this off I don't love this
song
the horsemen are drawing near on leather
steeds they write they've come to take
your life on through the dead of night
with the four horsemen ride or choose
your fate in dice
so when Teleca uses simple words not
pretentious they're sharp they're really
sharp this one I would say they're sharp
they're sharp be Metallica simple words
sharp
so
what other pointing here boss things can
we make up so um I think I decided I
don't want employees it's fucking up
it's difficult keeping myself occupied
you think I'm joking I'm not joking so a
person would naturally assume that I
have all kinds of work I should be doing
I've been changing this from silver to
gold and it was copper about ten years
ago about five years ago it was silver
and now I'm turning it into gold and
platinum okay so what other
Beamen Delhi so we have to find some
more of stuff to work on oh crap okay so
I I did some research on this on this
change disk thing and fuck let me show
you what we're talking about so
now I have to be a stud okay
so we're gonna install the distro inside
of us we don't have to do this
um change disk doesn't work there's a
simple workaround which is to remap
remount the cd-rom so what I could do I
don't want to do this so when you mount
a a senior oh you know what you know
what fucking
for ten years I used real hardware and I
learned a lot of lessons about real
hardware and I really don't want to fuck
with that code because I no longer have
real hardware to test it on the little
motherfuckers okay so you want to get
rid of CD ROMs right and then you know
what I have a native I have a computer
that runs natively and somehow somebody
fucking destroyed my CD ROMs like my dad
snuck into my room and fucking broke my
cd-rom drive I swear I'm not kidding umm
it's not the CD ROM it's the it's the
controller I think they fucking broke
the controller god dammit
when fucking Satan is chewing on your
nuts that's when you fucking that god
damn it anyway so fucking Satan and shit
so
so then let me explain
so watch this
I'm going to install from one cd-rom and
then change the cd-rom and then try and
install another CV wrong but that but
the the change just doesn't work in qemu
but it works in vmware but if you do a
mount operation then it works so what I
could do is every time you want to all
holy fucking shit goddamn I have a
vision in my head
Wow okay so check this out what if you
hit one command and it takes a whole
cd-rom it remounts it and copies the
whole cd-rom on your hard disk that's
why I make the big bucks that's why I'm
fucking god okay so
holy fucking shit
okay so when currently you have to
remount you have to do this let me just
show you out instead of keeping you in
suspense every time you want to change
you need to remount you need to create a
new what this does is a hardware reset
we're gonna say T probe 2 and then so
that remounts the drive and then you say
change disk oops I did did that wrong so
um
you want to know why I made the big
bucks what if I make a
when you hit a key is any copies the
entire cd-rom into a temporary directory
called cd-rom
the question is do we allow any other
access
if you have big balls you say no that is
deep that is the only way you use it I
think we're gonna do that that's what
we're gonna do so I'm gonna tear up all
my code so that the only way you use a
cd-rom is you hit one button it remounts
it and a REIT copies it onto your hard
disk in a certain directory a cd-rom
directory that's how the senior arm is
gonna work and you're not going to
access it
some people will complain and say yeah
but you should make it so that you can
have a No
you know random access to your CD ROMs
know what if I well what if I copied the
ISO I copied the whole fucking so that's
why I make the big books let's see
so I have an ability to mount an ISO you
want to know why I make the fucking big
bucks tell you why it fucking make the
big Bush okay so drive
you want to know why I make the big
bucks okay so we have some ISO is here
right what we're gonna do is reading
that we're gonna make a command so that
so that the only way the cd-rom works is
it copies the whole disk into a local
ISO and then we're gonna make okay so
you can mount an ISO
how do you do that I forgot oh I know
who did we say well we say I yourself
read drives a file name
can we hit f4
okay so now the M Drive is the ISO so
the only thing the hardware is going to
be capable of doing is copying from the
disk to an ISO file okay
do we want to do that what how much
would it simplify stuff so we're making
okay so the reason I make the big bucks
is because we're not making an ordinary
conventional operating system we're
making we want to cherry-pick we want to
make something that is different and why
is it why does it have value if I can
remove complexity so that the only way
to use a cd-rom is to grab the whole ISO
that's what we want to do okay so
the only cd-rom there are two cd-rom
commands read iso and right iso and
perhaps we don't even have a a drive oh
except when we boot we have to boot to a
cd-rom
so what am I talking about over here you
can't change disk it needs a hardware
reset when you do a mount it does a
hardware reset let's see if we can
identify it what the exact problem is so
that we could fix it like a white man
let's see okay so there's a there's a
reset command
maybe we should issue that and see if
that does it and if that's the case then
we can put it into change disk look why
don't we do that okay and I already know
it's broken I'm gonna save you some
suspense and fucking try and fix it so
we go - oh fuck
okay
things happen for a reason
things happen for a reason and not
always but anyway so if we go to the
colonel let's go to uh
and we're going to issue a reset to the
hardware every time you do a change disk
and let's see if that fixes it here's
the problem I don't have a real cd-rom
anymore and therefore if I make a change
then I could be breaking something that
already worked if I make a change I have
a lot of value because I did testing on
real hardware and it's kind of like that
asset is present in my code and if I
start changing it then then I might lose
lose the ability to run on real hardware
that's what's the analogy 488 and I
think this is what we wanna do
okay so should we just issue an 88 and
it I think this
I think this allocates a we don't have
an unlock we don't have an unbound
I think the read native max allocate say
a file information record okay let's see
if it works first 88 in it okay so we
know
this
we're gonna send a hardware reset to the
fucker
every time you do a change disk let's
see if that fixes it
okay so there is we have to unmount
let's just do this fucking okay
- okay
let's see if it works let's see if it
works right now okay first of all
control all - okay so we say change ID
do we have yeah okay good
ide1 all we have to see your own did he
give the file
so the reason I make the big bucks is
what if I make so that you can you issue
one command and it copies the cd-rom
into a local file the local directory
not just an ISO the one step would be to
make an ISO two steps would be to uh to
make it into a directory a local
directory hit a key and it grabs the
entire disk and puts it into a local
directory called funky so so we have the
hardware reset let's see if it works
change disk T okay
so you hit a key and it copies the
entire cd-rom into a into a directory
called cd-rom and then you can do this
so or we can just add this reset so the
reset is not good for multitasking let's
say you had two tasks that were
accessing the cd-rom and one of them
issues a hardware reset it's gonna fuck
shit up okay now let's see let's see if
we fixed it so if we fixed it and it's
gonna allow us to do it again before I
added that reset it would not allow a
second change disk let's see if I fixed
it
okay so ctrl alt T ctrl alt to now I say
DJ
how we see books one okay so one so
let's see the mount here's the big
moment of suspense did I fix it did I
fix it I fixed it I fucking fixed it god
damn I am smart okay fucking fixed it
trust me it was broken
okay so the question fucking so now the
reason I make the big bucks is because I
see new ways of doing it you hit a key
and it copies the cd-rom to a local drip
you just say cd-rom and then it copies
the entire cd-rom to a directory called
machines : / oh wow
so let's
we're gonna put this in our to-do list
because it's a brilliant fucking idea
maybe we beat until we have a committee
Beeman Teleca
okay I'm not gonna really
okay
okay so we have that as an idea
so
so now we have to we have to do this
right so
robustness is robust is king robust is
king so what is the correct answer I
don't know what is the fucking correct
answer I don't know this is not the
right answer this is not this is not the
correct answer but god damn its robust
as hell
this is robust as fucking hell so some I
think this copy let's see if there's
anything allocated that we need to free
before doing this
okay so we're what did you does reading
a reading in of Max does this allocate
anything I think somewhere in here it
allocates a sec to 512 byte information
sector where is that fucking information
sector
barking of machine-gun fire he used to
hear somehow the one do you play soldier
it device ID
I think this shit this allocates a block
ID we need to free this puppy
is that the okay we should make a of an
unmounting uninit okay
what's the opposite of an it in my
operating system clean up clean up is
the opposite of an it in my operating
system
one mount cleanup is the opposite what
do i what am I talking about in my
operating system in all of my games if
we take a game like this cleanup is the
opposite of in it and whenever we the
reason I make the big nut the big nuts
the big bucks is because unmount is what
a white person would say in my operating
system we use cleanup as the opposite of
an it if we have any other unmount do we
have any other examples where this okay
consistency is next to God godly
godliness should we read a policy clean
up is the opposite of an it okay no no
okay so
cleanup sounds nasty 88 cleanup what the
fuck
okay so these were originally not
designed to be remounted okay
so
what if I just free it oh damn I'm damn
I'm smart God you can't believe how
smart I am
I know why I'm a fucking genius I'll
tell you why I'm a fucking genius
okay
we are going to free the old one and
then mount a new one
so is blocked device allocated with zero
and I do believe the answer is yes but
there might be some cases were not so
okay so what is this faggotry what is
this faggotry here
what am I talking about what is this
faggotry
holy shit I free it
Wow I'm already a genius and I didn't
even know it
I free it
is there some reason that you
why do you pass this in there you
fucking nigger
it's fucking right there on their
fucking
look at this it's right there on their
fucking beady fucking nigger okay so
get device ID okay hold on
okay
shelf
eighty-eight device ID
is that the only thing
these Jesus fucking shit oh we don't
want to get it there
probe why don't you just put it on
okay no we're gonna do here we never set
to 0 and we doing
good device ID
okay that's why
okay you're forgiven you are forgiven
for what if we just say don't allocate
fucking
that's what we did say
why don't you just say don't allocate
dev ID
okay so this causes it to free it
if ID record
we free it here
okay
oh yeah
these are returning
you would
No
here what if we
should we free it in all cases
fuck you're supposed to free it if you
this is the case
no you know what we do I tell you what
would you let me see
what the fuck are we doing anyway device
ID if error
I think we want to say no we're doing is
he
you want to do that
I like positive logic I like to put the
short thing first I like positive logic
not always but anyway
you know what as a matter of fact oh
never mind okay so you know what we're
doing is incredibly risky because
we should
if you don't do testing this shit is
really unpleasant to test damn it I
should just be extra careful
okay
so you want to see if it works
so here's the situation when I designed
my operating system originally I wanted
to allow two people to use the cd-rom
right now all hell would break loose if
two tasks were accessing the cd-rom and
one did a change disk but you have to
ask yourself what the foot okay I don't
I like being obnoxious but if I can do
it correctly I would prefer to do it
correctly
in other words if I could make it work
for two cd-roms two tasks using this
easier on I would prefer that but if I
have to be obnoxious it will okay okay
so is that the only thing allocated I'm
pretty sure that's that's the
interesting thing
I fucking wrote this code many many
years ago but the interesting thing is I
know exactly what I don't think there's
anything else allocated okay let's let's
review what could go so we're doing an
extra in it let's peek unlock doesn't do
anything read native max so we went to
the bottom of this
get device ID
what if there's something allocated
somewhere else
there's not we can look at the record
okay so let's look at the block device
record see if there's anything there
like 40 that's not allocated what about
clearing it out
should we set it to zero what about okay
when you start over
you start with everything zero so
technically if I if I reinitialize I
should set this to zero actually all of
these need to be set to zero don't they
fuck so in my
okay we're not doing a remount overdoing
is issuing a reset so never mind we're
not we're not doing a complete remount
we're just doing reinitialized hardware
so we're actually doing it a white man
way of doing it we just were just
issuing a reset okay in other words it's
not bad it's not that bad so if we were
gonna remount then we would have to
clean up all this shit but we're not
remounting all we're doing is issuing a
reset a hardware reset ok
well holy
so we have to test the hard disk in the
cd-rom
and I have to change the
okay
I
I did I did it and it worked okay so
there was some kind of bug which killed
it's on the video
here we don't have to reboot
as a matter of fact
these look very similar
enjoy it some other day okay so I guess
we say fix I don't feel I don't feel
good about this do I
sometimes maybe you would call it being
beating a gorilla oh hold on is fucking
second this is only if it's only only if
it's cd-rom do we want to do this damn
it
BD
why are you using reverse logic
oh that's why okay
you know what we didn't do this very
carefully
if removable
you know there's not any other
okay
done I'm done and one of the next one
done done under the next one
okay so hard disk works
so I should really be extra extra extra
careful I should be really extra careful
are you absolutely positively certain
and say you're 16 what the fuck is I you
did me a you 16 pointer pointer
what about any
what about in the
plot device structure is it a u16
pointer pointer okay
command
okay
is a black device ID
we need to look up bike vise and see if
it's a year 16
yes it is a u16 place a traitor
so
I changed the code I actually made it
more aligned more lines of code the
question is if I tell people to get rid
of lines of code is it going to cause
bad code well I'm the one in charge but
I would one time I said we don't care
about
I was just going to let people anyway if
they could reduce the lines of code in
any way they they could we would allow
it
I know
I would like to to allow any sort of
hack that reduces lines of code maybe I
don't want to do that because it would
be part of the fun to get rid of lines
of code technically when I changed it it
made it more of lines of code
yeah so Disick school might be watching
what
if physics rule is watching I have to uh
okay
five minutes Thank You mr. chairman uh
mr. Burson secretary Johnson is quoted
as saying if there were legal limits on
his ability to do some background
investigations I think that was a really
unfortunate phrase that he used but
unless you and I see if we can kind of
demystify that a little bit do you agree
that non-citizens who are not in the
United States are not afforded any
protections under the Fourth Amendment
that's my understanding
well you were a US attorney and you're
being modest not only is that your
understanding it's also though all the
Fourth Amendment does not apply to
non-us citizens who are not here anymore
than the Eighth Amendment applies to
non-us citizens who are not here would
you agree with me that there is no legal
bar to accessing data from non-citizens
who are not present in the United States
well you also agree with me that there
is no legal right to emigrate to the
United States it's a privilege that we
confer on people but it is that it is
not a right it's correct sir
so would you also agree that you can
condition the conference of a privilege
on just about anything you want so long
as you don't violate a treaty or or the
Constitution or the Constitution but you
made I'm sure extensive use of
polygraphs when you were the United
States attorney all right and they're
not admissible in court are they not
generally but we still use them because
they are a very effective investigative
tool do we use them in the vetting of
people who want to come here with regard
to immigration benefits I am not
familiar with the policy in the refugee
context we do not regularly use a
polygraph if there's significant doubt
in the operational component given the
border authorities that ice and CBP have
typically the decision would be made to
bar entry rather
to go to the extent of trying to
ascertain the veracity but but you and I
didn't just use polygraphs in our
previous lives because we had doubt
sometimes it it and since the person to
want to embrace the truth when they
think it might be a threat that they're
gonna be polygraph
okay um I'm gonna shut down right now
bbl
wait let's let's go look in the chat
room first
okay I want to shut down
