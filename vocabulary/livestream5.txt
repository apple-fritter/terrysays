okay we're good so
I installed wine the Windows emulator
and I'm running if you go to my site and
you type files you can download sim
structure sim structure set up that's a
Windows application and you can I wrote
this in 2000 2001 2000 2001 so I want to
check something
this is a big test
so
there's a bouncy ball where is it
there we go okay so I want to test this
in sim structure check out how high
these different balls bounce the
basketball the super bouncy ball and the
golf ball now I'm gonna try the golf
ball on top of the bouncing ball on top
of the basketball and then I'm gonna
explain how it's relating to a supernova
probably not okay so let's make some
bouncy balls
okay wanna reset
so I think is there a snap oh no anyway
oh no what if it doesn't work okay let's
see
I think it failed
you can set the hardness I don't think
that's you know matter oh I know what
let's let's sit the simulation to higher
tire
dang I could swear there was a that I
did that I could swear I did that as an
example I guess not so um
this is this is flooding potential and
kinetic energy and total energy and it
does a pretty good job of conserving
energy which is a sign that the
simulation is good but it didn't do the
bounce correctly that sucks
so
I'm a day
so
this is for designing I wrote this
program I wrote this program so that I
can design control systems and not have
to build expensive motors and stuff so
you can you can pick this up
this used to be pretty impressive I
wrote this in 2000-2001 but now they
have Grand Theft Auto and it has a
compiler actually it's an interpreter so
for the control system you have genes
and I just monkied together a control
system PID controllers and stuff anyway
let's do a let's do a rocket
oh there's a reset
what is why isn't it
damnit
I can swear there was a hmm oh wow this
door rocket so
you are
put a thruster
and
okay so
the reason sim structure is a good
program is because boy it's been a while
particle to you
you can see
thruster one thrust equals
Lester won the rest of unsaturation
thrust times p2y about 30 - P - why
these are five units now
okay so this is what's called a well
it's oscillating
[Music]
now let's let's add a derivative
Plus let's see 0.001 particle 1
derivative in the Y so we're adding
particle 1 we probably want to subtract
a thousand
okay let's do more than
a hundred
okay
I don't know if it's making a difference
let's we should say p2
okay that makes a difference okay so now
we're it's
too much gain so zero point
okay so
so what we should do is
Oh
oh that was dumb okay so we have a
proportional and a derivative I'm going
to decrease the gain on the
you might ask why we have the
steady-state error that's because we
need to make an integrator I think you
can say Doughboy
so here so this was my first it was an
interpreter it's not a compiler
[Music]
PID stands for proportional integral
differential
so we're gonna make it let's see if I
can remember so error is equal to why
okay
now we say integrator
hi
now that will
this will integrate that error
now it it should to drive the error to 0
0 steady state error
oh we overshot
it's going to take a long time
so now we want to
it's increased differential
I don't think we want to overshoot so
much
well wait a minute I think we want the
other the other answer
it's
too much derivative
whoo oh no too much integrator
and we can plot the
if you say signal I do believe this one
Louise have to have sleep lot okay then
we have to see applaud you can see
okay
Oh
you
it's been three or four years since I
use this
damnit
actually I have this source good I wrote
it okay anyway all we can look at a
different example so let's let's file
save as now what the heck
rocket now let's be open
I think the
one of these has a
one of these has applied
oh this does
okay
so we go to
[Music]
a man window whoops
Oh
what
it had a plot it's not quite working
right it's got bugs didn't have
maybe that's because
I had the window open
so what just want to release anger to
three
anyway
out there we go okay so how do we whoops
there we go
you say signal do you assign and then
you just say plot okay
[Music]
no we open
rocket
-
okay so now you can see the error we
overshoot
okay so if you overshoot you want less
gain or more derivative the derivative
subtracts
okay that's really bad I think we have
too much integrator
oh you crashed
oh well
oh well that was some structure that's
what I did before templo s
so
I put the engine from sim structure into
Diplo se
for example
struck
so strut is uh
these are masses in Springs
the the connector is a member that will
break it'll break when you press that
key
thruster to you thruster one the rest of
three
okay so this is in Diplo s now I can
press one like your breath too
so
the code is all there
let's talk to God
- remember this program this program
reads the three gigahertz time stamp
count and then prints a random word
Prince of prints a word based on the
timer
Grouse
so we got some geniuses do we
so
I want to
honey we can new dude
Oh
I'm not much of a Linux expert
what the fuck
now on I foot
okay so
so see this time
now that's pretty fucked up
okay
I hit that bug before
why wait a minute email move what why is
it
any idea why it's not listed
Oh
oh it's in tad desktop okay everything's
clear
I have to copy
now I have to lease
and
do you think FC wined I just look I just
installed wine for the first time
well that let me say wine
what did it do
it's clicking
there's
the hood
flashed really fast okay sua CD
hey maybe I can click on it how do you
get it to show hidden directories in
this
oh I didn't put it in do you think it
needs quotes probably now that I think
about it
oh good
I think that's what I did the last time
oh okay
so just to be clear
okay
we probably need quotes
see how it works
okay how about no quotes
I don't know I'll work on it some other
time
any Linux experts so so this this is um
you can control the angle of the
thruster if you one angle for equals now
there's a Oh about P 2 X minus P 1 dot X
so now we're gonna probe okay it went
the wrong way
you wanna explain I speak to it
let's make it more gentle we oh there's
there's a heading okay we'll do that
so
now this is rocket science okay so
there's a spin okay first of all there's
the heading
I think it's a pie times
they're called bonds and particles
instead of masses in Springs don't ask I
didn't like the word member I was
thinking of members and so bonds and
particles you can put electrostatic
forces
I think we want unwrapped
I call it unwrap that that was on the
steak instead of wrap wait let's just
convert
didn't you slower keys baby I got it
yeah he's Laura gates okay
please
he doesn't appear to be doing anything
seems to be zero bond heading I think
you want to say
[Music]
let's put it on the screen I don't
remember how
okay
Oh
okay it's to its degrees
it's degrees so we see
I think there's an error
here it
oops damn
Oh Shi
I think how do you
shit
let's put this
this is interesting
step function
so it's
hovercraft
okay
what was the error
warning text even time identifier okay
oh so you
okay
so you might ask what are we doing this
is not see if it's uh is this a function
or what is this what this is is uh
statements they get integrated to get
executed every time it I don't know what
is it
statements that get executed every time
it calls the integrator call back anyway
if you put you can make things execute
on a schedule like every tenth of a
second
these ad signs make it make it execute
when it plots it on the screen so
the a variable all okay that's a one
time
it's coming back to me I wrote this a
long time ago okay so
okay star on signed
okay now we have the controllers
so there's a spin which is the
derivative of the heading
okay notice how now it's
we have a controller
okay so you can't know you can make it
go to an XY anyway I've showed what I
wanted to show
okay so now I wanted to make the
winnings
what is this
Oh
so
I'm just checking if I have the standard
yeah
so in my bin
we would see wine
Oh
so
Oh
mr. striker
hey it works
okay now
okay now
oh we have to see
okay
now
coppy
go to desktop
delete that
peace now
hopefully
shit
let's go to
they stopped
Oh
what are these look like
Oh
the other answer okay so now we go to
okay this is
okay now
copy
Desktop
beast
damn
dad
see
what did that do
oh okay now I know the problem okay
there we go okay just
they're okay
now
well
I would enough for
