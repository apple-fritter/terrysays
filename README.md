# Terrytalks

Generates Terry Davis phrases based on a Markov chain algorithm. The Markov  
chain is built from transcripts of video logs and recordings of live streams  
that Terry uploaded to youtube.  

```
The following command line options are available:  

-words        maximum number of words to print  

-prefix       prefix length in words  

  
Examples: terrytalks -words=1000 -prefix=4
          terrytalks -words=10
          terrytalks
```

I love Terry Davis. He was an honest, intelligent man and was wise in spite  
of his schizophrenia. He had his issues, but I focus on the positive he  
brings to the world.  

Sometimes when he communicated online, he used a markov chain text generator  
presumably seeded with text from the bible. At times he seemed to revere it  
as divine truth, and at [other times](https://www.metafilter.com/119424/An-Operating-System-for-Songs-from-God#4538454) he seemed to see it as silly and arbitrary.  

In the book *Neuromancer*, a person's personality can be recorded in a ROM     
construct that lives on even after they die. ROM stands for read-only memory,     
meaning the contruct can't create new memories or learn or grow in any   
meaningful way. The ROM construct is simply "a hardwired ROM casette     
replicating a dead man's skills, observations, knee-jerk respones..."    

Terrytalks is sort of like a ROM construct of Terry. I used transcripts from  
Terry's video logs and live stream programming videos to build the markov  
chain used to generate phrases. 

RIP Terry <3
