`stuff getting cluster fucked on accident
but once you start doing it
intentionally why don't you have to book
in the CIA literally clusterfuck stuff
on purpose flake jesus fucking christ
its bad enough it gets cluster fucked on
its own but then you get the CIA cluster
fucking shit on purpose i mean it's bad
enough it gets cluster fucked on its own
do you want to know why you want to know
why I'm the best programmer in the world
you see this this is the trend they
start it starts with hello like this
first year new professional seasoned
professional and master programmer okay
guess what I moved it backward okay I
moved it backward and that's why I'm the
smartest programmer that's ever lived I
took something that wants to be
clustered fucked and I made it simple I
took something that was cluster fucked
and I made it simple and beautiful
that's what I did
there's all these niggers that say oh
you should do this you should do this I go dude
if I wanted to make a piece of shit
clusterfuck I could do that but I don't
want to make a piece of shit clusterfuck
I want to make something beautiful it's
not a piece of shit clusterfuck okay any
nigger can make a piece of shit
clusterfuck okay any nigger can do that
okay
go fuck yourself Oh little india niggers
come in here this is what this is what
you get if you get an alien egg or you
get this shit I'll give Indian niggers
and stuff and you have the CIA aid
let me get an India monkey nigger you
start getting this shit
if you look at the code it will become
immediately obvious that I'm the
smartest programmer that's ever lived
it's immediately obvious
look at this I made an assembler I made
a compiler this is a ticket master
Beck's
Ticket Master that Troy wrote our
assembler I don't know how much was
original from Beck's syntax we use the
double colon that's where the double
colon comes from that was the Beck's
let's just look at that
I bet Troy used the same syntax a lot of
it was my first job was assembly
programming on a VAX operating system
for Ticketmaster
great
I've been paid to program in 6 different
assembly language instruction sets I've
had I've been paid to program in 6
different assembly language instruction
sets the fuck is that
back back
that girl isn't a surprise I just want
to see where that colon colon came from`,

`radio we're going to risk it I used to
use YouTube to and on my copyright
issues
haha so I don't know what's going to
happen fucking like the door closes and
another one opens
so let's entertain mr. God mr. God do
you like dance one time at Akash mr. God
how big he was you have to understand it
doesn't really mean anything that was
for sure
will will
there's a latisha wait so are Dan that
swims in the ocean I don't know about
that yeah I would do it I wouldn't be
very happy about it I'd be like oh fuck
don't really like this fucking sharks
and shit and fuck it's fucking crazy you
know it's like doesn't take much courage
to die you know cuz like you just die
like you know you have to conquer death
you have to conquer fear of hell you
have to conquer fear of creating
terminators and destroying mankind all
because of your mistake but once you
conquer that then you can beat the fuck
out our fortune a lot lightning I don't
know no no no it's probably bad idea I
didn't say that
fuck I'd stand up there would you ask me
I don't know that stupid what maybe he
can't fight because he's like a big
gorilla he really would
39 sounds like it's the age of a woman I'm 47
fuck fuck so uh that sucked so
entertain mr. god
it's not very nice give people
nightmares mr. Schwarzenegger fuck you
fuck yourself I like the uh
sergeant
fuck you
sergeant Potato Head on Generation Kill
just fuck yourself brains kill on three
fuck you fuck you ruining my 
theres that shit theres an old lady
ruining my fucking podcast fucking
okay brains kill now what a fucking crazy
psycho walking down the street yelling
at shit fuck
cause fuck the neighbors you know I'm
looney okay fuck yourself go fuck
yourself
that's sergeant Patrick I'd say go fuck
yourselves
that's right fuck yeah`,

`let's be clear I'm literally the
smartest programmer that has ever lived
ok you can download watch this you want
to see why I'm the smartest programmer
that ever lived
let me show you how I can prove that I
am the smartest programmer that ever
lived
here's what you do go to my website do
download 2 megabyte ultra small distro
save file now download the 2 megabyte
distro ok
and now after we download the T megabyte
distro in my downloads directory this is
why I am literally the smartest
programmer that ever lived
ok I am literally the smartest program
on that ever lived ok ultra small two
point one megabyte you see that it's 2
point 1 megabyte ok we are going to this
is why I am the smartest programmer that
has ever lived a divine intellect new
virtual machine I can prove it very
easily okay we go to typical we go to
downloads do this ok follow along go to
the ultra small distro other 64-bit
other 64-bit that's fine now customize
the hardware there is no networking
there's no sound card ok so there's no
networking no small sound cards its 2.1
megabytes ok what do we have we have a
we have a cd-rom that I didn't put you
need more memory I'm going to give it 64
gigabytes and 16 cores I have a Xeon
it's a beast
ok so
I'm the smartest programmer that ever
lived this is a 2 megabyte file ok look
at this first of all it boots a live CD
that's 2 megabytes remember this is 2
megabytes it has an install it
automatically installs so we say yes are
you installing in VMware yes press the
key so right now it's installing this is
part of the 2 Meg it's making a C Drive
and a D drive partition it's making a
it's copying all the files to see and
then it's copying all the files to D
this is 2 megabytes you can do this Reds
on my website you can download the 10
megabyte thing do you want to reboot yes
so we do this is the bootloader I don't
use grub I made my own bootloader it
doesn't use grub it's part of the 2 Meg
remember this is on human grub alone is
probably bigger than two Meg so we do
one for the C Drive so we just booted
the operating system and if you hit
control M this is the this is the menu
here's an icon let's see
a lot so I am the smartest programmer
that has ever lived on this distro our
it's two megabytes it has a flight
simulator
it has a on this distro it's a it's 80
mm it's 82 thousand lines of code
here's adjusted here's a 64-bit first of
all it's 64-bit watch this okay okay
let's let's do it on this there's an
editor test dot fully C dot Z we can say
use 0 start all right let's say fuck you
and let's say ASM actually we don't need
that it um if it encounters an opcode it
knows it's assembly so we can say move
our ax fuck
I'm the smartest programmer that has
ever lived
with just what that does is it puts an
ASCII string into our ax that's because
I learned that at ticketmaster and I'm
the smartest programmer that has ever
lived so we have a C program here let's
see that did not work
let's put string put chars lucky didn't
crash okay
fuck this is why I'm the smartest
programmer that has ever lived
fuck you okay you see that now let's put
another one fuck you
cares your turn let's put another one
here fuck you Terry turn let's list it
let son assemble this one assemble one
assemble function fuck you here's the
assembly code it loads an ASCII string
into our ax cause foot chars then it
loads an ASCII string and cause put
chars now watch this this will blow your
fucking mind the smartest programmer
that ever lived
you can mix C and assembly
from the smartest fucking program ever
fucking left okay ireally compiler check
this shit out look at that see that fuck
you fuck you fuck you Mars programmer
Evelyn FK fucking 64-bit compiler 18,000
lines got a fucking kernel got a fucking
graphics library you see my fucking
graphics library it wrote the triangle
root still I wrote the I wrote the Cruz
my fucking graphics library we're at the
triangle fill all that shit in here I
have a video on how to write a triangle
fill and check this out we can put
sprite okay so some reason I'm the
smartest programmer on earth we have
graphics in the fucking source code
control are ready to make sprite let's
do let's do a 3d mesh how about that
let's do 3d mesh okay yes and okay let's
do prism thickness 25 okay
always going to fuck up I fucked up you
can't do con convex you can't do concave
okay anyway so this is not flash it is a
fucking 3d sprite let's put it in here
how about this sprite on the smartest
programmer ever fucking lived with you
why I'm the smartest programmer ever
fucking lift I'm telling you I have
divine fucking intellect we're going to
print that sprite watch this at the
command line
Devine fucking intellect see that look
at all those sprites see those sprites
let's move them over fucking Devine
fucking intellect I'm not up MIT nigger
I have a brain okay fuck you went to a
real school not a fucking CIA fucking
brainwashing place fucking CIA
brainwashing all they teach you is how
to be a fucking monkey nigger look at
this shit look at this fucking sprites
command line fuck you fuck yeah fuck
yeah I guess it watch this motherfucker
let's go to the kernel control D here's
the let's go to the kernel okay let's go
modify the kernel
you want to do the bootleg let's put
let's make a DLL how about that is that
so let's uh let's copy this fuck you
let's put it into a DLL okay so make um
let's just put it in here
how about that throw right here okay so
now when we boot let's do a quick boot
fast boot now there's a DLL fuck you
look at that now we go fuck you
let's make it do a startup and do a fuck
you the DLL okay let's go over here we
can do DLL fuck you
DLL okay fucking the smartest programmer
ever fucking leg motherfucker
let's do it in the startup after it
starts up let's get rid of that shit um
make um let's see okay folks you now
when we boot it's going to do that when
you reboot fastboot all you do it I'll
ask to Adam send me Adam it's up here
okay duh so it's in there fuck oh well
whatever okay that's the Adam task to do
it once
let's do please II was being caught once
used to be called do it once once that's
the HC let's see oh that's trippy oh
yeah okay now let me see okay I think
and get rid of all this shit gonna
happen yeah let's get relaxed shit okay
fuck fuck you okay now my reboot
we got when it starts up it does the
fuck you see that okay see that I know
what we do now we're going to make a
distro okay you know what a distro is
that's an ISO file let's make a make
distro we want to modify the kernel
don't we let's modify the kernel
otherwise you might think so we want all
the source code is here you can do a
mate call basically what we're talking
about is the kernel and the compiler
that's the only thing that you want to
do if you want to modify the compiler
and modify the kernel let's modify the
compiler so that at the command line it
says fuck you
so we'll go to option of these in here
command prompt order communal and prompt
okay so this is in the compiler it's
built into the compiler and what we want
to do is if you okay so now we're going
to recompile everything let's let's go
to the kernel and let's modify if you
want to modify the scheduler so what you
learn let's go to a well is end is the
fuck you nigger
fucking MIT nigger get the fuck out MIT
name for good a real school huh fuck you
fucking learn how to program
look you
always fighting the last war making them
eunuchs all you can think is UNIX is you
got fucking Munich's on your nigger
brain fighting the last word okay now we
go BB now we go we little boot hard disk
stall C and we want C C carriage turn
probe you have to tell it which drive
come out one for and I'll do we need the
cd-rom not what the fuck
originally installed I think we better
add that steep t probe that's gonna
become fucked up I think we don't want
to do that fucked up okay same - oh well
now let's make the distro go to home
directory this will make the distro an
exact district what the fuck is that
oh my god make home on make district do
distro okay let's do distro
this is going to make an ISO file I have
I have a I wrote a routine to make an
ISO file so what we have is a self
reproducing 100% all of the source code
look look on this disk okay there's the
boot loaders if you want to see the boot
loaders go to Adam option boot loaders
here's my here's my hard disk boot
loader use this inner up 13 interrupts
1342 all it does is it loads the kernel
and starts it in real mode and the
kernel changes too
active mode we have multi-core did you
see we have multi-core because we have
multi-core started up on this side the
smartest fucking programmer that ever
fucking live I have to fucking divine in
all I shall suck my fucking cock you
fucking nigger fuck you okay fuck you
okay fuck you fucking nigger fucking
nigger so now you know mount virtual
desk fucking divine intellect okay fuck
you
and we go to
here we're mounting the disc and we
mount it now we're going to go to the
mount point and fucking few Meg's that
has a flight simulator compiler kernel
editor
it even has graph it as it has a sprite
editor a mesh creator 3d mesh creator it
has a I'm on the fucking I have divine
fucking intellect fucking nigger you saw
god fucking talking with the fuck's your
malfunction get your ass beat you little
fucking CIA nigger fuck you man fuck
your shit up little fucking CIA nigger
fucking come and mess with God you get
your ass fucking kicked you the fucking
nigger you know how this ends the CIA
sucks my cock that's how this fucking
ends ok that's how this fucking ends you
knew it you know is going to happen so
now we're just got this ISO file from
now I'm going to unmount it so what do
we do we go to CIA sucks my cock that's
always fucking ends because it's fucking
God and I have divine fucking intellect
ok that's how it's fucking ends and then
denial you fucking nigger divine fucking
intellect ok so now we created an ISO
file now we're going to new virtual
machines typical we're going to choose
the just approved that it's fucking
going to my distro 64-bit
other 64bit to split customize hardware
we have no networking no sound card to
Meg we can verify fiume USPS to Meg okay
we get fuckin smartest programmer ever
fucking leg fucking divine intellect I
just fuckin proved it now we're loading
the the ISO that's created
fuck you and mighty nigger did you see
that that was during the boot space now
we got this fucking shit you see that
because fuck you fuck you a mighty
nigger now we go to like simulator see
this shit fuck you live in my teenager
I'm going to talk to the smartest
programmer I ever fucking live but cage
suck my fucking cock
so we wrote how did we get divine
fucking intellect off fuck you little
fucking CIA nigger put monkey leader
how'd that happen huh huh huh yeah it's
right motherfucker
trash kicked`,

`okay so I'm gonna go chase that bug that
I was chasing earlier um I am at home in
my van
this is my my new home I need a pillow
okay without further ado oh shit oh shit
okay so so we're chasing a bug so when
when you put print statements and oh
someone someone fixed it someone said
they fixed it
let's go see what they did
someone said they fixed a bug well
aren't you clever
so we've got a is a a seat pal
so we have to the only way that to mount
it is uh okay let's see what they got so
how are we gonna do this
so go
file
oh shit shut down shut down it's hot in
here
file Mountain virtual disk password
okay
and
well I always okay but TOS is the O and
oz like okay
we always mount the D partition for
transfers and on my VM disk okay so I'm
out and let's go ahead and CD don't just
don't like her
I'm a little bit uncomfortable so pseudo
CP me SS star /mnt fish BM disc
okay it worked so now we uh
file
okay and I'm not closed now we start
this puppy up
let's see what that person provided me
with
so I'm gonna go ahead and maximize yeah
VMware you always have to resize it okay
so if we go control m to the D Drive and
CD
so I don't think it was mounting with
the foot let's see if it moves
it mounted okay I have a sponge in there
let's see if I say find sponge
that's my new way of labeling it yeah
look at that
no no no no fuck I have when a doctor
does surgery he has to count the number
of sponges they left inside according to
mash do you know mash anyway what the
truck maybe I didn't recompile
okay anyway so it's mounted so we go so
now we had now I needed to do a diff
let's see what he's got on there huh
their report Red chief reading foul read
essentials so Drive
I haven't really done this in a while oh
you should wise got fancy alright
lower the centrioles okay chair to load
a binary
Wow
I just been doing some work he doesn't
sound like he'd fix the Red Sea
maybe his this is an alternative to the
Red Sea
okay well that's I got an email saying
he fixed it I think he's just showing
off his network stuff Oh what the heck I
think I know this is this from Alec
Murphy
hello
[Laughter]
I sort of concealed the way to make
binary files he figured it out I think I
told him that tell him what's it gonna
be
what you gonna do what if it corrupts my
master copy I trust
whoa look at that
well I'll leave that
yeah
snake
Wow he's very professional cool
so you say gonna fix my
so I hope it's just um I hope I just
introduced a bug that would be the maybe
it's simple you know maybe I just
introduced a buck nothing more than that
I I thought that uh Hugh EMU was not
supporting red seat all of a sudden I
it's bad when you suspect other people
of your bugs anyway
okay so is this crashes it's in
how did I forgot what I did in an
earlier episode hidden black device and
it wasn't it fuck I'm rusty
okay so hey there's that welcome I said
I search for sponge what the fuck I said
find sponge what the fuck
Oh
[Music]
find sponge
there we go okay so the surgeon has to
count the number of sponges so okay so
it's printing not read see I so final
read it's probably not valid then as
prote it is so for some reason maybe I
have some uninitialized values or
something I don't know
read see validate let's go into Ritchie
validate okay we can get rid of I think
max blocks was looking good I think red
see validate is the question is is it
correct
this is invalid or is it
okay so later to drive luck read read
see mr. B
[Music]
okay let's I got a six going
well it's not ready to read it
okay now okay so they'll put this
difference between good programmer and a
bad programmer he's not lazy Oh No
well I wanted one difference okay steep
quick wham bam thank you ma'am
beep okay let's go there
d
shut up moduli yeah kay it's months
puppy
Sixers hey look at that damn I'm good
damn I'm kid okay so Sixers in size okay
find
hey where's max - max black still there
what the fuck I can remove that fucker
the fuck is it trips me out why does it
there what what the fuck
oh it's on the D Drive okay you gotta go
to this C Drive fine okay so I can swear
I got rid of that they just not didn't
save it nests right okay so the max
blocks we're being a little bit quick in
her judgment let's print the signature
just to be sure
just to make sure what is and and
sectors you go sighs sick there's equal
size what did we get we got something
great
okay let's let's see where DB size gets
initialized DB size is equal to nothing
okay we got an it partition let's just
go to Colonel black do
control-f sickness size
yeah
find directory size equals okay besides
see you there's where you knit it equals
sectors
how could it get different okay so did
would you double do red see in it of
course we did how do we know what did
that
okay which one let's look let's print
this out how about that control insert
shift
okay do it
hurry up we're on the time clock
actually we're okay
don't have a very comfortable seat
it never hits them it that's weird
validates it myself it's not valid
validates it later doesn't it why is it
not valid what if this was created wrong
what if it was created wrong
okay so fuck hey let's just override
that get rid of it what's that gonna do
it's off by 8:00 it's off by 8:00 where
does that ring a bell
fuck eight times
what if those created rung let's
good-looking huh
so then it didn't do normally gonna
drive see
[Music]
[Music]
what they should do that
don't worry
so
okay let's see so maybe my ritzy is
being created wrong size
let's play that one what was the size of
the file how about that one of them is
the size of the file okay so uh zero
aches
control
okay we wanna divide this by 512 that
you would get
+5 later
this is never a wash
okay the file I think you got ahead 80 y
no - 80 - 80 fuck you
so
okay well
so
the ISO has some header blocks
let's see
[Applause]
well yes I got a good look so I'm gonna
go let's go to get the difference
between a good programmer the bad
programmer not lazy
what something like that hey okay so
let's look for size
I could swear my f3 is not working what
the fuck's up with that
there has functioned weird
yeah like that
thank you
okay so so there's a there's an overhead
for a cd-rom and then there's the Red
Sea filesystem
we're getting in discrepancy what if I
knew well it's just that's not a good
test I could get rid of the let's just
try this this is a bad idea
fine
so right here we cannot
okay
so we're just gonna ignored the check
okay
now I'm comfortable
I haven't programmed in a long time
okay you knit that's pretty crazy
13:04 so what if I try to install oh you
want to install it's probably fucked up
at the end isn't it
why did it all of a sudden start
happening around fuck maybe the size
changed
and it started happening okay so uh well
but a memory what do we get
okay so CD I was trying to do the file
manager
okay DRV maybe it's corrupt in this way
okay
so decide
let's go listen to some hymns but a
memory
oh my god
this three cake
okay so
it's not very happy
something's fucked up
look into the world
Colonel hacking okay so fine
okay so I guess why don't you not be
lazy and do it bit by bit
fuck because I want to be lazy so either
the either the file was created wrong or
now it doesn't do them it validates it
before it initializes that makes sense
the validation is off
okay
rid civility which look for that
read fuck it right there size is equal
to max' black plus 1 dairy offset
what if the sectors per cluster is no
there's no sickness per cluster max
block secretive directory entry size /
block size
it's not off by one it's off by a lot
what is it biddy
these sectors
what does photon wise before
leaning on my pad gotta get used to
notebook
ramdisk that's not the problem
you know the tapi is wrong too
let's worry about this first
so when you format you set the block to
my sectors okay this is super rich
okay
TV says
trash
oh you know what I think its rounded up
where did we allocate the motherfucker
wait a minute
TV size
sector skills from TV size
Moonves
- Drive offset that's where just so the
drive offset let's print the drive
offset how about that
so far read
here it's printed reserves it
this is the 80 blocks header that she
have on a cd-rom
motherfucker I hate when the cursor
jumps that's what I don't like about
laptops one thing
okay prett drive us it
robust 58 hex
you're gonna get rid of me
it's too big
what
so somebody likes debuggers
well
good luck
so how would you use a debugger okay so
58
so the
50 is 80
58
he
fuck you
[Music]
buuut block
max watch
well shit
of any let's dump to boot right now
let's dump the Moo trigger that was that
[Music]
okay so
oh yeah
glass red
Oh
break
okay so what if I print Br
you just want to make it extra for us
this way
you get fancy but there's simply
so we're gonna we're gonna add this
we're gonna add this to the colonel
as an extra
so now you're too
this is a pretty tricky punch
temporarily
the extra now it's a report
this is where we have import rate
okay so now we go
okay
so
sectors
[Music]
Plus aimed in two blocks
they're off by 8
it's a cd-rom it's rounded to a four in
four is it
file size CD ROMs running to a four
you don't have any me`,

`so there's something called idolatry
which is where you consult a material
object as a god and you worship it as a
God so this is a this is one of the
worst this is one of the worst sins and
so you have to ask yourself am i doing
idolatry and here's what I here's how I
justify it basically first of all
there's a there are pendulums and
atheism we get atheism then we get
belief in God we get there's a there's a
pendulum that swings and what I am doing
is a you know it was it was pegged at a
hundred percent atheism now it's going
to be pegged at 100 percent God okay
because what I am doing is kind of rude
it's kind of rude to do what I'm doing I
you might ask Harry what are you doing
proving God with idols that's kind of
fucked so like why did they not why
didn't here's what they did they they
created up fear and stay away from idols
in Germany they created a fear of
witches and so what you have is you have
a barrier that keeps people from doing
stuff the people that do believe will
the believers will stay away from this
stuff so non-believers are not
interested so what you have is a
situation that um as the door it's a
gateway so here's what here's what
happens you get a monk who you get a
monk and one day he randomly opens his
Bible
and he says oh my god it talks to me he
looks around and he's like no that's
that's idolatry we can't
that and so he like sets it he said he
sets it aside then he says just do it
again then he oh my god it talks to me
so here's the problem you have to uh you
have to have a context you have to have
a context in order to detect a response
in order to have communication you have
to open up a channel so what that means
is you need words you need a and once
you have okay so here's the deal let's
say you have okay there's two things
that are needed you need a context and
you need an offerings
so basically God will not give you the
time of day if you impose on him yep you
have to make it worth his while chuckles
fucking car
it's it's an imposition on God and the
only what he's only going to talk to you
if you exchange entertainment in love
that he like steel trade with you like a
space alien trading post but if you
don't do an offering he will not talk to
you it's that simple
and you might it has to be something he
wants okay like Cain and Abel K King
gave vegetables Abel Gabe steak God said
get the fuck out of here with these
vegetables what are you doing insulting
me with fucking vegetables get the fuck
out and that represented a lack of love
what do you why didn't he have got meat
you know that's the idea of love I had a
Jewish law suit he says you said in
Judaism food is love okay well that's I
don't think he I don't think he knows
what I know
but anyway so what you need to do is
exchange entertainment and love for a
response okay they need two things you
need an offering that that that pays the
way it makes them willing and then you
need a channel so you have to have some
mechanism in order for him as anything
random communicate okay so uh let's say
you have a flame and you say right left
right right left right a B C B you can
make a flame do it you can make the
intestines of a cat gut I don't know you
can make we can make a general dice and
you can you know even if you don't you
can make people do it like if you if you
doing offering to God and then all of a
sudden you know the car starts making a
loud noise that's an example of
communications you know or maybe you
overhear you're in a city and you
overhear somebody talking it's like wow
where two or more are gathered I am
there in their midst I can even do like
a seance kind of thing where if I put
myself in a certain state if you say the
first speak in English don't speak in
gibberish say the first word that pops
in your head if you really want to do
that it's kind of kind of add don't do
that some some techniques works better
than others okay Ouija boards are crap
the the timer if you take a nanosecond
stopwatch for random numbers and pick
pick from a list of there's a hundred
thousand Linux words some some
vocabularies are better than others
anyway so uh that works it's one of the
best things to do is to just read
randomly open a book that works really
really well it's really easy to you know
I told Frasier the fucking nigger monkey
it's like Frasier Wyatt why don't you
fucking open a book after doing an
offering she's like I'm not that stupid
that's it doesn't work so Frasier spends
ten fucking years saying you've hacked
that that does random numbers on online
Frasier fucking do this right open a
fucking book after you talk to God for
five minutes fucking nigger monkey oh
I'm not that stupid fuck you why do you
think they did fucking offerings in the
Bible they're fucking do it they're
slaughtering thousands of cattle and
shit right so take why would they do
that shit you fucking retard you have to
do offerings to get God to talks okay so
uh so when it comes to idolatry how do I
justify what I do here's the deal if you
if you roll dice and you think the dice
are alive and that they are God that's
what I call idolatry okay if you roll
dice and you think God is inside of you
that is Christianity that's where you
think that that that God is within me
jesus said by the fathers in me I am in
the father okay if you rolled dice and
you think God is controlling you that's
Christianity what I believe is I am an
avatar God is in another dimension he
has full access like a Star Trek
transporter or something yes full access
he's in another dimension he's just you
might as well think of him like
he said he didn't make the universe but
there is perfect justice on earth so you
might as well think of them like a space
alien in another dimension and if you
entertain him he will talk ok that's
that's the healthy way okay because
there's perfect justice so it's not just
a space alien it's a it's it's there's a
massive structure imposed on our world
which caused by angels and stuff that
causes perfect justice on earth and
anyway so I'm going to randomly open
what's the day of rest by the seventh
day God completed his work which he had
done and he rested on the seventh day
from all his work which he had done
following the sixth day of creation the
Lord deliberately stopped working
arrested take special note of that
lesson that there was that there was
nothing else he could have done it
certainly wasn't because he was
exhausted I meant omnipotence never
grows tired he hadn't run out of ideas
for omniscience knows no mental
limitations he could easily have made
many more worlds created an infinite
number of other forms of life and
provided multiple millions of galaxies
beyond what he did but he didn't he
stopped he spent an entire day resting
in fact he blessed the seventh day and
sanctified it something he did not do
for the other six days he marked this
one day off is extremely special it was
like no other
sounds to me like he made the day on
which he rested a priority a period of
time`,

`okay so it's not every day you do
something
this epic I'm about to do the most epic
thing in the history I'm about to do the
most epic thing in the okay here's
what we're gonna do we're gonna convert
the sound to 8 bits where you can
convert sound 8 bits is that fucking
crazy okay so you know what do we go to
sound directory I know where people
might be angry but fucking you know why
because we got the bomb okay so uh
because we got the bomb okay so note the
frequency where is that note
where is frequency
do you God said he wants 8-bit sound
note to frequency okay let's go ahead
and remove this from here escape okay
note to frequency okay so are you sure
just to double-check I wouldn't want to
get this incorrect I think I did it from
memory
that's hilarious okay
anyway I should probably use the octaves
of a piano okay 440 actives of a PI you
know is there a what do they call is
there an official octave for middle C
88-key piano okay so designation look at
that look at that look at that - will be
official what do you say people so we
have 256 to work with oh he said signed
he wants it fucking signed
holy fuck hahaha
a character oh my good heavens gracious
okay so we do it signed well there you
have it
is 88 gonna be okay what Oh God here
that means it'll go really really low
holy fuck that's what he wants
it's gonna be assigned okay that'll see
4:40 okay so metal C for middle C is for
a 440 okay so a 440 is octave for 440 is
octave for are you sure be absolutely
sure yes for forty is octave for okay
are you sure don't fuck this up Gav 440
is octave for okay so dear Lord okay 440
is octave for we should use a lookup
table okay so no to frequency
440 is octave for okay we got here
note the frequency 440 is high deform
okay so let's do this very carefully
okay so we are gonna have something
called a note and it's going to be an
8-bit signed value okay and we're going
to get rid of octave out of our stuff
okay so let's write a little you know
write some documentation people want to
know did you write documentation fuck no
I didn't write documentation did you
write a spec fuck no I didn't write a
spec what do you think I did I fucking
what are you nigger fuck you okay so no
to frequency okay how do we want to do
that just fucking do it
quit fucking around okay what do we call
these notes
there's octave and note and then there's
note we can invent a word for a or for a
sometimes it's good to invent a word
this is some wisdom I've learned if you
make oh if you make hello no no
what because it's impossible to use
github no it's public domain okay bye
okay so now let's see here what word
should we invent for note
- uh
a Touareg you want to use that word
that's what God said
- uh
this is it - uh okay but don't focus it
to it it's one of these you want to call
it a one up
one him to do it and the woman to do I
do
I wanna want it in they do it to us
okay so we call this at two up this is
an epic see okay - uh okay
so we say yeah - uh - frequency
I
- uh - frequency okay so we say - a - 3
+ note ok so all of my octaves are off
by one first I have to fix that let's go
slowly let's go a little bit slowly okay
so my octaves are holy fuck okay these
need to be active for okay
look frequency okay first control f
okay sound we'll go ahead and put this
in here
it doesn't really want to just do to us
in this okay let's put that back okay
put it back
merge D okay so we put these number two
okay so first of all we gotta fix the
octave we're off by one
okay so fuck okay let's see it where is
all that shit okay it's relax it's not
that much so we go to the sound
directory music
are gonna be it's just look for octave
magic ace okay
octave No
music sent octave
okay
he's accepted
okay
I do
octaves are entered of the digit
stations okay
tzedakah
no to frequency are different I give for
okay let's see if
no too frequently hey make sound sound
effect make sound files
there's no octaves in there draw CT
activity equals four no number in octave
- frequency okay and right here you also
want to use a - uh - frequency oh no no
no we're going to other direction we're
we're going a note to it - uh that's
what we want to do go to frequency
note
- - what
and we might as well call it an I hate
note number
okay
and this is none other and octave mine
is for
okay this is
octave times 12 plus note are you sure
okay this is a no-brainer
actually okay you want to call it a
wonder know what's called it to us you
want to call it a one it should be a one
a not a - up oh and a want to check for
that
let's go Google oh honey
looks good to me a 1-up why would you
why would you call it why would you call
it that to us it's a ona it's a one
at least it's a it's like octave a 1-up
octave times 12 plus nope
100 K and so let's look for note 2
frequency okay first we want to get rid
of all the octaves or fix all the
octaves okay so it should be okay note
to frequency what we want is that one up
to frequency note aunt one up enough
enough and then we want frequency
well that's kind of middle C is 12 times
for a 0 B 1 C 2 we're not gonna have a
default are you kidding me
okay so 48 plus 250 fitty okay oh wow
that's kind of fucking cool
you think they planned it okay now I say
so fiddy whatever do on that divided by
12 I'm confused
case is correct I'm then divided by 12
let's see let's just do it just do it
okay so note frequency I'm not different
just do it
okay fine okay now you know we know we
say no to freak machine we say one I'm
not on that to frequency and then we see
not frequency okay let's see if this
works now it should be off by a octave
okay okay so let's do this so let's
start me fuck you
oh no okay
note the frequency okay okay so now my
song should be off and I'm different
they should be an octave too low I could
do high that's one
okay now you know and now we we have to
change all the octaves are those being
set where are those being fucking sick
okay hold on a second
the do I do I set odd I don't set the
duct octave do I know I I just attacked
him okay
oh fuck okay so I've changed all these
songs not a problem okay we are
professional grade okay why are these
loop these are low and they're coming
out high I don't understand why are
these coming out high they should come
out low shouldn't they what the fuck
okay how about no hold on
octave for note 2 what do you eat
nope oh not well that's not correct
how'd that fucking happen
four times twelve Oh No octave okay oh
fuck did I screw that up okay maybe I've
gotten backward nope
why would they be backward they would
not be backward a note note to octave
for okay well this is obvious okay 50 so
under two frequency No - you octave four
so this is supposed to be metal scene
it's very high oh it's supposed to be oh
do you know how lucky I am
okay octave 4 is a this before 40 so
what the fuck seriously what the fuck
okay so I fucked something up okay so
for 40 is octave for no let's just get
this straight
middle C is something like 2 ad or
something
we correct
hold on a is 440 and its octave for
correct don't fuck this up okay
are they inverted up is up down is down
okay no I not didn't burn it okay well
good good it's messed up so 50 is middle
C and that that is wrong so let's fix it
50 divided by 12
how why is it wrong
it's way too big why is it way too big
let's just what are we looking at 50 you
suppose 48 is supposed to go to 440 okay
how are you gonna be what are we looking
at 2
- ^ its octave for 4 times X is that
what we're looking at its active for
something similar to this so
why are we multiplying by a 440 okay
4:40
if we take the natural log natural log
of one is zero
[Music]
oh the fuck am i doing let's just fuck
around with this till we get it right so
it's way too big why is it way too big
so let's see it's embarrassing okay
we're with that so we got 48 it goes to
440 if you go 12 up 36 goes to 2012 down
60 goes to 880 okay so therefore we're
looking at
oona divided by 12 why is it not just as
a 2 to the power on the / - oh is that a
fraction is that a decimal hold on a
second
is that integer Anna is an integer
divided by 12 point oh that converts
okay so what are we looking at - 2 to
the fourth
let's do it - to the fourth wait wait
wait
- to the fourth goes to three or fourth
goes to 440 so we have to divide by four
forty wait wait wait wait
- the fourth is a 16 divided by 4 40 so
multiplied by four forty divided by 16
okay let's just do this multiply it by
four forty weren't a divided by 16
that's kind of guts laughing at me oh
why don't we do it you want to know
subtract okay I guess so
when is 48
but that fucks it all up why are we
putting the sign there that's not what
it's supposed to be you want middle C is
going to be 0
I guess so well holy shit that's not
what I intended okay
you know anna is a is not like that okay
so somebody talked about the Fahrenheit
scale they were making fun of me they
thought that I was a dumb fuck
not capable of being the greatest man on
earth so they thought I was a fucking
Fahrenheit my god I'm not a fucking dumb
fuck fuck you okay so you know what we
do middle a is on on a zero okay so oh
yeah that's what it is
okay little C's
I give four
that's a lot what do you think you think
we should put this is kind of fucked up
no it's not fucked up I'll just change
that you idiot okay
so if we say -4 okay fuck just divide by
16 how hard can be let's just put that
there done I'm done on to the next one
what if we made no we're not gonna make
that's better so they're off an octave
and now we have to uh convert
okay so now we this is fun isn't it fun
this is fun okay so we're gonna write a
program to press to convert this song
you know what is
let's just do it just fucking do it
fuck okay so are we done no we have to
let's convert the music Oregon fine No
not very many people are in the god
league of human intelligence you have to
experience creating a new word before
you you start thinking like a god okay
so
now we we looked for somebody needs to
be changed is that the only thing I
think that's the only thing okay
somebody let's just change the octave I
think it's open okay let's go to the
Samedi did God mind right three
one two equals four Oh No
ought to be reformed
octave equals four
boy I really fucked that up didn't I why
didn't you check I don't know why I
didn't check because I was an asshole
okay
so I think we're good
okay is there anywhere else in the whole
operating system all the sounds have to
be changed that's not much of a problem
what do I have to do / - yeah that's all
I have to do is / - I do believe
okay so no no no that we're doing Una's
okay that's normal isn't it octave three
thank you no it's not normal what do we
need a new octave I think would you okay
fun yes we do need a new heart okay what
is your malfunction where do we set that
fucker how do we set that fucker
oh we do % D okay we have to look for a
% d % D here it is durations ok % d damn
it fine directory T we already draw no
we don't want drop mean draw controls
here we go yeah yeah no it's not part of
the controls jukeboxes no has nowhere
fuck you ok fine what are we looking for
we're looking for the menu where do we
sit the menu draw
well look for octave 9
we're always set menu is our fucking bin
directory f1 let's go look for media
let's inform any cement refined yes fuck
you
how do you said it fucking I forgot
menu entry find not a sub entry okay
there it is there it is okay octave % D
I looked for % T motherfucker
oh nevermind okay octave % D 0 to 6
okay we are now going hero to seven
and it is off and octave that's what it
should be less than or equal to seven
okay
just do it done I'm done the one to the
next one done on an iPhone
we don't have a zero anymore
don't have octave 0 1 to 7 it doesn't
that that note doesn't play but in the
future it might ok octave 0 we don't
have an active 0 but we do okay we're in
the God League the god League okay
zero to nine okay so that's handling
digits okay so what are we expecting is
it supposed to be off why is it off we
said no to frequency we're converting
the frequency it should be correct why
is it number two octave three at the
start it's are you fucking kidding me
so what
somebody find directory free
no it equals three
why was it three what books malfunction
oh we got that shit son okay so no I do
is that are you sure it's me it's all
MIDI it starts out octave three I can
swear octave three what is it that sets
that working for
when we draw it what are we drawing
octave honey swear me
it's right there I liked it Mindy makes
really fine I do check the truth
PS am sit active okay fine
yes and sit finally they're just fucking
around some bitch
PSM octave
PSM menu fine PSM
PSM octave or is it a default coming
into
okay we're going to use a mini yes I
want it okay
PSM I do
did we fucking sit that motherfucker
Wow I could swear how did I miss that I
did a very careful so that scares me
whenever I missed something it scares me
let's do it
excuse me when I miss things okay
where is that anyway we're good
right there there it is okay so no so it
should be often Achtung
no no that's correct okay we have octave
one doesn't work do we want an octave
zero okay now we we are we done no or no
you know the next step we have to
convert all the songs okay
so we have to write a sound a song
converter so do we want to Lex
the problem with lexing is it gets rid
of comments and it reformats it so we
don't really want to Lex it what if we
look for string constants and change
numbers inside a string constants I
think that might be our best bet will
that have any side effects on a song if
we look for a number inside of a string
and add one to it
oh oh we have an additional problem oh
is that true no it's not a problem okay
so now we want to look for numbers
inside the strings and add one okay
fuck at least it doesn't change the so
we go to templates this is a document
template okay copy
let's go to home and you might as well
convert song okay
what is your footing brown bird song
gate control F my util convert songs
how about convert you know convert song
okay replace oh okay so now
we want to look for a string being
converted okay well we can do it you
want to see
[Music]
24 per octave that's a good idea maybe
so half note
no we're gonna go with 12
middle C is to 61-62 let's check that
out % 0.6
Oh
I wanted to honor wanna
ahna 50
Mel C kidding me middle C is 260 1.6 -
shit
the other answer oh my god I almost
fucked it up Jesus Christ okay it was
correct hold on a second here
50 we have it set to high whoa okay hold
on a second here
whoa thank you I almost fucked it up
- twelve is uh fifty minus twelve is 38
wait a second here
2004 wait why are you seeing for weight
let's do zero before for 40 okay so this
is middle a middle C is you're saying
it's 261 that's deeper a a is deeper
you're not correct this is middle a are
you saying that's low lower a than
middle C fuck there's that 440 is active
for oh maybe it's just my middle C
that's off so octave 3 note C is 0 is a
Oh a B or a okay well we got to do the C
be ok a is zero zero one zero one two
three oh it's three okay
so middle c is octave three
okay middle C is active three but our
octaves are off
okay so 440 is active for are we correct
for 40s active for
440 is octave for I think you'd swear we
we covered this
for four days active for but middle C is
we need a fucking singing
what the fuck is this shit
a socket for
oh my god you gotta be kidding me
these guys are fuckin Fahrenheit
Fahrenheit niggers Jesus Christ look at
this shit are you kidding me
the sea is the start of the octave
instead of a what kind of retard nigger
came up with that
so I should we fix it okay I should
convert it correctly because my songs
are all broken so I had to do this
anyway my songs are all broken okay
fuck
I made all my songs I made all my
software there is no DRM fucking nigger
I'm gonna ban that fucker
fuck you
this evil God
okay so do we want to fix music or do we
want
okay
so the UH knot is correct so the enough
for the owner / 16 hold on a second here
sink thank you for thank you for finding
okay
so
nope - Ana okay
we want to add we want to subtract to
off okay it has to get fixed here that's
all we have to do so if if if if if if
nope okay nope it's less so yeah a let's
look at this a b c a a sharp B C C sharp
okay so if
middle C is active for did we see and
440 is octave 3 440 is a octave 3
let's just let's get that right okay so
middle C is octave for
as I know that you said it was too
little see is to middle C is to 61
middle C is octave for and middle a
octave for a is 440 okay
that's fucked up okay so it'll C is
active for
so a is zero a sharp is 1 B is 2 C is 3
C sharp is 4 so if note is
less than three
I could I almost fixed music I almost
fixed the music industry you niggers
okay
fucking retard nature's okay so so if
nope it's less than three we take octave
times 12 plus note
we take octave - one
octave for
okay
did I do this correctly I can't think
I'm sorry I can't they okay notice less
than three
plus one that's what we okay
it's pretty good okay so we say we say
percent
12:26 F on the tip frequency why did you
put the note order backward
I guess it's forward okay is there a
default on that let's not have a little
C is octave for okay
enough so octave four is middle C so
nope nope zero octave for this is
supposed to be 440 why are you fucking
shitting me
oh I fucked that up
okay so we have to do
is it
it's too high
try again okay
little C is active for so middle C is
12
Oh
I'm confused fucking I can't think hit
12.6 out come on
one extra frequency no note a octave for
oh my god
I'm feeling pretty embarrassed
okay 4:40
okay so middle C is octave for note 3
261 okay now we have it correct okay so
now we just have to rate the conversion
and everything will be wonderful let's
see if everything still works
oh this is fucked up figures oh damn
that is fucked up oh my god is that
fucked up what oh Lord
dear Lord
so we're all those notes okay doesn't
look too bad
so what just happened eh oh this is a
there it's not note a by the way so so
what are we looking at middle C is H is
C okay so H is C like that's not too bad
H is C so that means where's 8 years h h
is see that's why don't we why are we
doing this
zero okay H is C
HSC how many of those did we have not
very many
okay these are not an octave up
is that all there is are you sure okay
so
[Music]
good it works
[Music]
[Music]
how come that's correct does that
convert it to the letters or something
what about this is this fucked up
this is fucked up isn't it dammit this
is this is fucked up I'm sure it is
of course it's fucked up what did you
think of course it's fucked up
shit okay okay so this is okay but the
notes are fucked okay so
let's convert him to Una's and then
okay so
nope
let's look for octave octave magic keys
set octave okay that's not wrong
I do
recalc XY okay so now we want to convert
these to it on up
okay since we have an honor
why don't we convert it to it what do
you think people
okay no I don't feel like doing that so
if note
did I do
if not-it's less than zero note equals
11
okay this is fucked up this needs to be
if note is less than three oh shit
so fucking nigger design this
was he German that made the piano jesus
fucking christ
how hard can it be a is the fucking
beginning fucking starts on see
you want to convert these to an enough
okay
[Music]
of course we should convert it to Ana
that's the glory of Donna where do we
want to convert him to Ana that's the
question okay
we want to convert from not okay we need
to write okay now we have to do the
other direction
on earth anata o unintuitive
okay this
I'm interactive
Oh
you think I should tell computer science
people
they'll just have to find out the hard
way
okay so we say
oh we have a we have a division for this
you know that there's a math routine
mod there's a mod I could swear we have
a mod for this mod 60 mod to you 64
give in return ECT form
quotient
okay well why do you 64
nope
equals five you 64 address 12 and what
do we say if no it's less than three
returned
let's see
what about sind
if it's negative sake enough fuck it up
we do want negative why don't you just
do that
how hard can it be
what does mental see no - okay sure
460
fifty-one
okay middle C is 51 a a sharp you see
zero one two three why didn't they make
it fifty Jesus Christ oh never mind
middle C is 51 okay they started at 1
instead of 0 you know what no they
started what little C is 51 okay okay
do we do in our documentation do we do
single-spaced yes do single-spaced
under frequency
okay let's see if we got this correct
okay so let's see nope
note three octave four is not less than
three no
wait is note less than 3
note three octave for three it's 36
I know see his note as active form okay
note 3 is 4 times 12
51 okay 51 modulo 12 is 3 know
three-octave
51 divided by 12 is 4 is no less than 3
no so it's 4
so what what is 440 is
what is that that is middle a is 440 its
up higher isn't it yeah okay okay so we
say
so okay
now you see
what are you doing okay so three
okay so okay looks good no
little a
okay so we got it correct now let's go
ahead let's see about our music is this
under sound we don't have music sound
run it to frequency
why don't I say midsi do you want to
replace metal in the whole operating
system okay
okay now we go to the glossary and we
make an abbreviation entry every time
you use an abbreviation you have to
register it one time I thought this was
bad and not good anyway H mg mg s quick
okay okay let's go to sound know the
owner metal see is on a 51
why don't we say fuck
our notation is a little bit sloppy
because a note is kind of sloppy but it
is sloppy so at least it's better with
it enough okay
I think we're saying okay so let's see
what's here
[Music]
okay so
so
and all we have to do change these to us
as soon as possible so let's find the
octaves let's do that
that'll be a clue fine okay this becomes
an enough want to change all these to
honest
just fucking do it just fucking do it
what's up Tempe in Tempe in is a note
okay
no documents
I guess we teach all these too honest
no let's not JC's Donna's because people
know
fucked up shit okay
would this be improved if I changed all
these to honest no actually as a matter
of fact and unof is an absolute value
not a it's not a a note is actually
relative
so as a matter of fact I have a good
excuse not to change those to Una's so
do you want to change him to honest
okay so the XY
we need to change list
the y-value its
if note is less than three
oh wait let's make this an honor okay
if it is not a meter then we're not
equals
octave okay what about we have to do
modulo hold on a second here okay
like to rest that's zero I do believe is
it not I think so
I mean I holy fucking shit
okay wrong answer
why is it negative sharp is lower what
the fuck what is your malfunction
sharp is lower what the fuck sir should
be higher what the fuck is this shit
flat
this could be oh well maybe it is we're
talking about who knows what this is
okay
okay we already took care of that one up
oh we have to go plus or minus
I think we just do the why don't we the
fuck is this no map
what the fuck is athis I think we just
do the honor knowing what does no twerp
Oh
Sawadee fine director note ma'am okay
a sharpie
okay
okay so up and down is inverted sharp
you want your Y to go up flatten you
wanted Y to go down
and this is here we can get rid of that
why are you figuring out this fucking
note shit
measure National Lab
Thanks
okay
why are you figuring out note is there
only four why that's all you're doing
I'm gonna so I think we want to do the
UNA times
octave times 7 minus 2 I think we just
want other times 1 that times 4 okay
what do we got okay
it's inverted for one thing so if it's
inverted let's put this back the other
way
put this back the other way and it's
invert just fucking do it okay so so a
is note 6 note 6 octave 3 so we want to
octave times 7
Oh
it's harder than I thought is it and we
do need to note in the other one don't
we okay so
okay let's go ahead and
okay
- well
hey that's not correct anymore because
the notes are scuffed up the note the
note map is no good
let's see where the note map is used
okay fine
okay so we have another one of these oh
dear Lord we have a lot to fix
okay
I don't want to be on television anymore
I don't
you`,

`but it's God's official temple God
designed it and so nothing can stop it
I'm just giving you a heads up you know
CIA you might want to adapt to the new
world order because you fucking missed
the end of the Cold War and you fucking
missed the return of God God's going to
fuck your shit up nigger
the CIA missed the end of the Cold War
and they missed the return of God he's
gonna fuck your shit up we have to
entertain God that's the purpose of the
universe is to entertain God if you're
not entertaining God
you have no purpose except to take care
of the people and entertain God God like
soap operas okay so CIA is going down
the CIA has been cluster fuckin
everything but say hello to mr. God
nigger
the New World Order mr. Gaad is the boss
and I'm high priest we the world
entertains mr. God so guess what there's
a nigger on this website
these motherfuckers keep I wrote a
fuckin these motherfuckers keep I wrote
a fuckin compiler who do you think knows
what they're talking about these fuckin
niggers is a immediate addressing I
wrote my fuckin compiler I can do these
things you can't because your nigger you
not write your compiler the difference
in a professional and an amateur
operating system is writing a compiler
if you did not write a compiler it's
amateur i Ticketmaster we wrote the
compiler difference in professional and
amateur operating system writing a
compiler I've been a professional since
1990 anyway
so these motherfuckers trust me you are
not in my league
I wrote a fucking compiler you call me
God cuz you're not in my league niggers
with attitude don't even know their
natures so over at OS dev as usual
they're pissing me off by
misunderstanding my code they have said
it won't boot it kid there's no way it
boots it's been booting since I started
93 anyway so this is basically they
they're trying to start my Connell I'm
assuming they're talking to me and
they're trying to start my kernel
without doing it the correct way okay
okay so for some reason those sons of
bitches cannot do their are everybody
else hit yes yes yes if you're in a
virtual machine hit yes yes yes and
that's all there is to it for some
reason they want to boot it in box or
whatever that debugger thing is they
can't follow simple instructions box is
some kind of cluster fucked thing full
of bugs that none of them mine has been
64-bit since 2007 thought so they expect
me to debug box for them I'm not going
to debug your stupid your thing doesn't
matter and you have a hard disk that you
bought in the last 10 years you want 42
that OS dev they're retarded they're
evil they make them they make the poor
kids do sector head cylinder arithmetic
they're fucking evil they're they're
sabotaging them none of that shit yet
there hasn't been hard disk that small
in ten years and it's even harder it's
easier to use the DAP you should tell
that God they're wicked fuck
the OS dev CIA evil fuckers making the
poor kids use cylinder-head sector you
want to use interrupt 42 and if Fox
doesn't do it then get the hell out of
box that's that's the evil they said
they'd sabotage waked fuckers anyway
they're making all the poor kids
oh well making them all reinvent Linux
and stuff so I'm kind of wait okay go to
the hard disk and advanced IDE one one
why did you put it on
there's IDE zero there's IDE zero zero
one one
I'm not kidding these motherfuckers play
musical chairs with the fucking disks
they put the hard disk ok let's see that
one zero one one they did this just to
fuck with operating systems they don't
want the CIA doesn't want anybody from
China or India making an operating
system ok novelist to get the SATA ports
it turns out that say the port interface
is kind of old-fashioned they're not
going to do that anymore but as soon as
we kick the shit out of them with divine
commandments they are going to do shit
like that but anyway anyway so it's now
think about this what we really need is
the well here's what you need a king you
be king to kick the shit out of the evil
CIA here's the New World Order that the
guy so uh so when I am King I'm going to
kick the shit out of the industry and
we're going to standardize this shit and
we are going to here's the new world the
new world order we make the hardware so
that temple OS is glorious and minimal
we make the hardware to make temple OS
glorious that's what we do that's the
new world order
I went looking for it how can I transfer
Ubuntu from mistake to a new okay do I
swear it was like a 12 step process and
if it's 12 steps I really don't think
very many people are doing it it's like
birth control if you make car seats and
if you make children a big enough hassle
that causes birth control and if you
make a big enough hassle to install
Linux you can kill Linux by just making
it 12 steps and so I'm going to command
the industry to quit don't even think
about tiny desktops the virtue of a
portable is smallness the virtue of a
desktop is powerful you want powerful
you're it's like your compete you're
confusing what your strengths and
weakness is the CIA is making the
desktop think it wants to be small
no you're it's like a man who thinks he
wants to be tiny no men should be big
and the desktop should be big it's
powerful and you got them all confused
gender-confused you got tiny desktops
what why are you making nobody gives a
shit about a calculator size desktop no
that doesn't really do anything I got a
fucking floor space I got I want to I
want a monster computer and they got rid
of the cd-rom they don't like that they
want everything in the cloud where it's
under lock and key
the little motherfuckers we're gonna
kick the shit out of them God and I are
gonna kick the shit out of the CIA fuck
them up
they got everybody wanting wristwatch
desktops why the fuck would you want a
risk watch desktop the virtue of a
desktop is power big big screen full
keyboard big mouse power horse power you
don't make a pussy desktop what the you
evil motherfuckers you got these poor
confused little stupid kids wanting a
tiny desktop the hell are you doing and
here's the problem if you make a tiny if
you make a Celeron then suddenly little
Timmy's game that worked on his i7
doesn't run on his neighbor's Celeron so
you got to have everybody with powerful
desktops all desktops must have eight
cores we're going to standardize this
shit that's what we're going to do`,

`go-go-go what is your problem
there we go
okay
I'm going to write an email
she doesn't respond
anyway we're gonna find some some topic
to get God's response
let's see
what's a good article
nothing good
about
what the fuck is it
no we're not doing that
so
so this is Clio
Snippets
this pick some random words
so there we go
more okay so we get a response a couple
of minutes
we're going to NASD 7:27
so here's n ist they have
you know we could go to other random
sources
so they publish first beacon generated
numbers cannot be predicted before they
are published
second the public time-bound
authenticated nature allows user
application to prove to anybody that it
used truly random numbers not known
before a certain point in time third
this proof can be presented offline and
at any point in the future
can't believe we did this topic
the French 5 2 9 5 3 oh we picked the
first 5 decimal digits
shoo
and this is that were on his feet
what
blood what does blood snow I know I put
smells like
Oh
we're asking to talk about
let's go - ready
Christmas
really stupid
really stupid
okay so now we go
I'm not worthy
Hey
okay let's see
[Music]
33
[Music]
33
e o 966 no they don't
96 809 96 a toad 996 what did I close
that window
dammit ito 996
that was eight fold 1996 what are we
talking about almost closed
I forgot what we were talking about et
okay
okay
everything from Microsoft is a sour note
that you don't want to hear Bill Gates
is a sour note that you don't want to
like make it stop what do you think
mister guard
Oh
wicked wicked you're going down on
motherfuckers everything is a sour note
know what this is about
let's just go get one directly fuck it
Wow Oh let's just do this oh you know we
should do we're alive or did Scott
wasn't ready I tricked he tricked God
and let's see if he's ready
hee hee the niggers
auction
hey what happened
okay let's let's do some more let's find
some more shit now it's the best time
just uh
Ebanks
on these water
well we didn't do that instruction
so in inside temple OS is
inside temple OS in the compiler
directory there's a file called opcodes
and it has the up codes with the
addressing modes and I didn't do SSE
mmHg but the only I did
I put the register names so I started
doing them but I didn't do him so you
can't do em mes s MMX sse because just
fuck you
I don't know if - for me who is it who
says because fuck you it sounds like -
God is the boss you're not the boss of
me
some people don't know that integer
arithmetic is faster than floating-point
no you know what we're gonna do we are
going to go to random.org and get number
no it's gonna hop it's we're going to
take the first five decimal digits
and so oh six seven one six oh six seven
one six
six everyone six
normally I can see
so somebody else can do it I don't know
if we want it I think it's crap
if you're doing matrix math otherwise
it's crap
a lot of people
there's a lot of important matrix math
maybe down
she doesn't talk to me
so that's cool
[Music]
United or let's see who's gonna win the
United herb Li Chester and what the hell
is that
Arsenal we're doing uh put a thousand
four seven two six three four seven two
sixty three and the Lord says there's
disassemblers disassemblers I have heard
the congregation of meaningful doers and
will not sit with the wicked I will wash
my hands with innocency so will I
compass the altar Oh Lord that I may
publish with the voice of Thanksgiving
and tell of all thy wondrous works lord
I have loved the habitation of the house
and the place where thy honor dwelleth
gather not my soul with sinners nor my
life with bloody men in whose hands is
mischief in the right hand is full of
bribes but as for me and I won't walk in
my integrity redeem me and be merciful
unto me my foot standeth
and then even place in the congregation
why bless the Lord
how about that a little miracle
let's do another one
who is I don't know you don't know who
that is
they gave authorities the slip in a
Prius now the quorum of wanted men in
the world are stealing our Toyota let's
go places back in the day sailors used
to tell stories about these monster
waves these waves were enormous two to
three times taller than the tallest
average waves even in stormy conditions
and big enough to sink ships as big as
ocean liners and oil platforms they
would talk about being battered by this
giant wave and barely living to tell the
tale and these waves would form in the
open ocean randomly spontaneously and
without an obvious cause but people do
exaggerate and scientists who study the
ocean didn't buy it these tales of
so-called rogue waves
we're happening far too frequently to be
true and according to their calculations
rogue waves could form based on a
phenomenon known as superposition when
two waves combine crest to crest the
waves double in size and when they
combine softer crest I think let's see
what mister God says about that
49:54
49
thus I cleansed thus cleansed a them
from all strangers and appointed the
wards of the priests of the Levites
every one in his business and for the
wood offering at times appointed and for
the firstfruits remember me oh my god
for good a book of Esther now i came to
pass in the days of Ezra's this is a
hazardous which reigned from India even
the Ethiopian over 107 Tony provinces
then in those days when the King
hazardous 7 the throne of his kingdom
which was nutrition the palace in the
third year the rain he made feast and
DAHS princes and servants the power of
Persia and media Betty
the nobles and princes of the provinces
being before him should the riches of
his glorious Kingdom in honor of his
excellent majesty medicine amenities
okay enough of that
Oh dud I guess I don't know
so
yes
so
she uh
[Music]
she was a
where she worked as a software engineer
designing mobile apps so she programs I
guess she went to MIT the other day I
was speculating if she used Linux and
somebody said that at MIT they would
laugh at you if you used Windows so
that's kind of cool anyway so she could
do it what you think you think she let's
see what God says I think she could do
SSC MMX
where are we going here
so this is
she's got better things to do to be
honest
doesn't she have better things to do
I think she's
she's good in front of the cameras
then everybody's good in front of the
camera
what do you think mr. garden good in
front of the camera
what do you think is Stallman mr. god
let's go
to 165 3
one six five three
and the chariots of Israel cried unto
the Lord for he had nine hundred
chariots of iron 20 years he he mightily
oppressed the children of Israel Deborah
a prophetess the wife of that but does
she judged Israel at that time as she
developed under the palm tree of Deborah
between Rama and Bethel in a mountain
hear from the children of Israel came up
to her for judgment and she sent and
called Barack the son of AB Noah out of
condition if Tolley and said unto Him
hath not the Lord God of Israel
commanded saying go and dress toward tab
or and take with the ten thousand men of
the children of Naphtali and the
children of Zebulun and I will draw unto
thee to the river Kishin Sisera the
captain of Japanese army with this
chariots and his multitude and I will
deliver him into thine hand and Barak
said and earth if that will go with me
and I will go but if thou will not go
with me then I will not go
prophetess
so let's find something yeah see
something you want God to talk about
quantum entanglement is boring
so this person probably doesn't so I
have a lesson to teach okay we're gonna
do a hard court lesson me okay so so
there are a lot of
let's say we're keeping track of pennies
okay so it's important to keep in mind
cache miss so what we do is we do these
twice Oh
what I should do oops
what what what what you idiot
this kind of weird
okay it makes sense okay anyway
so look at the time but what do you
notice it's six times slower or five
times about five times or whatever or
okay so let's take that there are a lot
of I find the stupidest people
if I'm using integer math they assume
it's because they don't have a
floating-point processor I liked when I
was young the float was ten times slower
now it's about five times slower anyway
I can't even talk to somebody who's so
stupid so if you can use integer use in
a jerk now how can you use integer for
fractions well let's
okay so
close to 500 5-4 see what happens now my
compiler is not very good I guess what
you have to say so it looks to be the
same so what can we do if so if so if
you want to do money I learned this at
Ticketmaster if you want to do money put
pennies into an integer if you want to
do money put pennies into an integer and
that's the best I guess some people have
to have fractions of a penny not very
often so what about if we have 100 times
sign
okay so what if we have some decimal
now look we have error it's supposed to
be eighty four point one now what can we
do in order to make this work I'll tell
you what you do you take this shift it
thirty two and when you print it
Oh
fuck that out
okay
well this is embarrassing
do you have any bow you know what this
might not work
let's do this
okay I really hate life I'm not having a
good day
let's divide by
oh that's kind of weird
why didn't it convert it I might have a
compiler but what though we are way
fucked Oh
first of all let's change it to you I
don't think that's I am happy let's
print this maybe it's overflowing no
it's not
50 should be a hundred times sign 84
okay so it's 84 we're adding
oh this is weird
roughly two
thirty-two
got any ideas people this is
embarrassing
oh did I do that
so you know the two f64 might not work
I can look at the machine code
oh it's overflowing that that's no
excuse
eighty four point one four okay maybe
let's divide by
for well
84g we're getting warm now
there we go look at that that's
beautiful now what the truck is the
problem
are we overflowing why would we 100
million what is this honor million
oh we're overflowing you idiot I always
have this problem this happened the
other day okay
so we take 10 to the 32 times sign and
[Music]
so
we have some error but the time is three
times faster so this my friends is
what's known as fixed point math and
anyway a lot of people a lot of people
they they make me furious when they say
it's for when I say it's for
no floating-point processor make me
furious now on a with the better
compiler is the results might be closer
that's possible anyway so let's go ahead
and let's look at let's talk to God
we're going to get some radioactive
numbers or radioactive hot biz so this
genuine random numbers generated by
radioactive decay we're going to take
the first five decimal digits nine nine
seven eight zero nine nine seven eight
zero nine nine seven eight zero
she'll stand afar off for the fear of
her torment weeping and wailing and
saying alas alas the great city that was
clothed in fine linen and purple and
scarlet and decked with gold and
precious stones and pearls for an hour
so great riches has come to nought and
every shipmaster and all the company in
ships and sailors and as many as trade
by sea stood afar off and cried when
they saw the smoke of her burning saying
what city is like unto this great city
and they cast dust on their heads and
cried weeping and wailing saying alas
the last a great city wherein were made
rich although that had ships in the sea
by reason of her costliness for in one
hour is she made desolate rejoice over
her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and
prophets for God avenged you on her and
a mighty angel took up a stone like a
great millstone and cast it into the sea
saying thus with violence shall that
great city Babylon be thrown down and
she shall be found no more at all what
I have I have tests

yeah I can tuck what my texture
so we're in the test suite
why don't you
if you're writing a text editor why
don't you go to the colonel directory
and look at Edie this is my emergency
editor it's only it's about it's 300
lines of code and I suggest you do that
so I'm gonna post a link
so my editor is ultra deluxe and
complicated my emergency editor is
probably what you want to look at
there is probably what you want to look
at
if you want to know what my editor can
do
we're doing this
so my editor is
I use it for my command line and this is
it has page commands and it can do
columns of text like this it can do
graphics and columns a text that has
page width it has margins it has so the
full editor editor is probably not what
you want to do it has graphics and
source code it has active links it has
syntax highlighting it's it's really
deluxe that's why I showed you the the
emergency editor the command line is the
same editor and it has links and it has
macros links and macros this is a prompt
PT
there's a there's a routine this is the
this is the heart of the editor recalc
it does wordwrap it does anyway
so yet your editor is altered deluxe no
fonts it doesn't do fonts so it's it's
not that integers
so this is the heart the heart of the
editor the recalc it redraws everything
everything
so as you can imagine there's a there's
a big switch statement with all the
keystrokes all the keys have their own
there's
this is this is
cursor left is kind of complicated
I think
the editor is really complicated I I'm
not gonna waste my time talking about it
I could well
it's awful
there's a lot of people in denial on God
these people are in denial on God
so it's
nine seven seven three seven
well what was manifest in these last
times for you who by him to believe in
God that raised him up from the dead and
gave him glory in your faith and hope
might be in God seeing you have purified
your souls in obeying the truth through
the spirit unto unfeigned love with the
Brethren see that you love one another
with the pure heart fervently be born
again not of corruptible by the Word of
God which liveth and abideth forever for
all flesh is a grass is this grass and
the glory of man is this a flower of
grass the grass withereth and the flower
thereof falleth away but the word of the
Lord endureth forever and this is the
word points by the gospel is preached
unto you wherefore laying aside all
malice and guile and all guile hypocrisy
is in envies
all evil speaking as newborn babes
desire the sincere milk of the word that
he may grow thereby
that was a dud more or less not
miraculous what'd you think of the race
mister God oh come on you get a cookie
can you hear me now taunting dudes that
just golfer dudes I just got for
revolution tomorrow credibly threats
you're lucky now that I think about it
enough Obama drama I Regis oh hell no
your negress wrath stuff hasta hey
that's right strip application off the
record and that's all folks driving be
right back don't mention it I didn't see
that nope I'll think about it
not very miraculous
[Music]
I redraw everything 30 times a second so
[Music]
as a matter of fact I even redraw what's
not on the screen if we go in the Bible
as a matter of fact we're using we're
using 53% of uh CPU so it's it's doing
the whole Bible I redraw everything I
what I I did do an optimization for okay
so the the command line window is a
document and you can it's it's the
editor so the command line is my editor
and what I did okay so I I have that I
told you that the recalculate is the
heart of my editor and that goes through
the whole document actually
when you do this it only does the the
bottom part of the document so as a
matter of fact there
I don't redraw the whole document when
I'm now what if we put the cursor right
here it does from the cursor down
so
so when it redraws it it goes from the
cursor down does the remainder there's a
reason why I redraw the whole document
watch what I'm gonna do I'm going to do
I'm gonna do a margin control L page
setting left margin for T okay so we
have a margin command now watch what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna do what are we on we
are on the line I don't know that's okay
I'm gonna say control control L cursor
movement we are going to go up the page
- mm so
it's kind of ridiculous how powerful my
editor is
it redraws the whole document 30 times a
second but it's really powerful
oh it also uh anyway so I I placed a
priority on features what okay see what
God says God says AB stiffly positively
no more tears from I'm afraid you're
fired
sure burning I love this climate radio
beats adjust for inflation
you never know Jesus that the way we
move there it is resume you'll see your
rich Cluj are you feeling like a
catastrophe server sector you're out of
your mind
threads now that I think about it but of
course from sad naughty fun no pain
mine is better mine you don't need if
you want to do assembly
watch this well you can just put
assembly instructions
it recognizes by the out code it
recognizes the out codes
so we printed hello world I'm a I am the
best programmer on earth I was given a
divine intellect in order to make this
god I consulted God the whole time and
he puppeted me
what do you think of Obama
two six eight five six
through an abuse me but his armor-bearer
would not for he was so afraid therefore
sought took the sword and fell upon it
and when its armor bear saw that's all
was dead he felt likewise upon his sword
and died with him so Saul died in his
three sons and armor baron all has been
that same day together and when the men
of Israel that were on the other side of
the valley and they that were on the
other side of Jordan saw that the men of
Israel fled and that saw and his sons
were dead they forsake the cities and
fled and the Philistines came and dwelt
in them and he came to Bassin tomorrow
that the Philistines came stripped of
slain that they found saw his three sons
fallen in Gilboa
Obama is amazing is pretty much the CIA
is a seus they're fighting God as hard
as they can
we do you think of this mr. cart see
something about this
you are gonna make God's temple and I
what are you fucking confusing people
for 14 nanometer could become a long
note I'm fucking talking about
maybe they're talking about the assembly
that I just did
you're gonna make
a divinely designed chip are you going
to design the chip God
okay let's go
five four six three seven
there shall no evil happen to the just
but the wicked shall be filled with
mischief lying lips are an abomination
to the Lord but they that deal truly are
is delight a prudent man conceal his
knowledge but the heart of fools
proclaimeth foolishness the hand of the
diligent shall bear rule but the
slothful shall be under tribute
heaviness and heart of man maybe that
stoop but a good word maketh a glad the
righteous is more excellent than his
neighbor but the way of the wicked
seduces them a slothful man roast not
what which he took in hunting but the
substance of a diligent man is precious
in the way of righteousness is life and
in a way thereof there is no death
intel is evil that's why they're
struggling they used to be good I would
when I'm in charge I am firing this man
has fired little motherfucker made the
chip slower and he's trying to make him
tiny he's trying to get rid of the
desktop fuck that fucking nigger doing
the opposite of what I said he's fired
you wouldn't see how to make a built-in
function what functions should we make
I wouldn't count
tricky
stuff working with my compiler I
wouldn't count on tricky stuff working I
should say I made a new language and it
works the way it works
see if we have any questions
see if we have any questions
[Music]
so spider-man is a homo
pretty much
I spider-man homo mr. God
the nigger brain cannot understand what

seven 909 zone
um
if you read this god is not the god of
the dead but of the living
Jesus says God is not the god of the
dead but of the living I asked God if
the world was perfectly just he asked if
I was going and lazy
so there's justice in this life and I'm
very doubtful of this another life
what do you think of that
God makes elephants
what are we gonna do
Oregon and New Mexico's that was Indiana
but you understand how people see this
as exceptional basically both candidates
understanding and recognizing the fact
that they're not going to win on a first
ballot and making a deal essentially
saying you take this date I'll take this
date yeah well for both of these
individuals the second ballot is
critical to getting the nomination and
for John Kasich side you know he wants
to have that opportunity because he is
of these three candidates still in the
race
we only one who has proven that he can
win in November and ultimately there's
no point in this entire exercise of
having a primary process like this if
Republicans cannot win in November the
goal is
how many of you know that 16 words in
President Bush's State of the Union
address
how many know my wife's name now how can
you know one and not the other
when did the question move from why are
we going to war - who is this man's wife
I asked the first question but somebody
else asked them and it worked because
none of us know the truth the offense
that was committed was not committed yes
it was not admitted against my wife it
was committed against all of you but
that makes you angry
or feel misrepresented do something
when Benjamin Franklin left Independence
Hall just after the second draft he was
approached by a woman on the street the
woman said mr. Franklin
what manner of government have you
bequeathed us when Franklin said a
republic
the responsibility of a country is not
in the hands of a privileged few we are
strong and we are free from tyranny as
long as each one of us remembers his or
her duty as a citizen theocracy bitches
say hello to theocracy bitches
I didn't mean that
I didn't know I was sexist

come to me and him that cometh to me and
no wise cast out for it came down from

weekend edition from NPR news I'm Rachel
Martin and it's May 1st May Day which
depending on how you celebrate means
workers protesting in the streets or
dancing around a maple if there's one
thing that can bring us all together
though it's the puzzle joining me now is
Will Shortz puzzle editor at The New
York Times and weekend editions puzzle
master hey well good morning good
morning Rachel and remind us of last
week's challenge yes I said name a
famous singer first and last names the
last four letters of the first name
spelled backward plus the first four
letters of the last name spelled forward
read together in order name a section of
products in a drugstore what is it well
the singer is Mariah Carey and that
section is the haircare section
okay I'm gonna shut down`,

`okay so back to the front so hum
you know Dilbert and I don't really like
Dilbert I used to like Dilbert but now I
see it as populist leftism it's Marxist
Dilbert is Marxist the boss is stupid
you know I kept hoping that I would that
the comics actually were making the boss
smart and the people stupid why do I
like Gilbert what why do I just like
Dilbert
it's a lot harder to be a manager than
an employee
so like for example I don't like it it's
fucking leftist I can't believe I used
to I sort of liked it you know I went on
a and went on a trip to a job interview
and in the parking lot someone had an
license plate Dilbert and they asked me
if I liked it I was like shrug you know
what do you answer I mean I don't know
anyway so the thing that annoys me is
its own it's just a low-level kind of
humor instead of I kept hoping I loved
it sometimes you can sort of see
unintentional where the boss is smart
and Dilbert is stupid that's what I keep
hoping for I was like let's go see some
Gilbert well anyway so um so the other
day it's hard to keep your head on
straight
so and originally I put these numbers
because I had a problem identifying if I
saw if it caused that if there was a
glitch I couldn't tell where it was in
the sequence so I put these numbers and
these numbers were a pain in the ass
because you have to read number them and
so I made this if you do ctrl T this is
a I did I don't like to show off what
does it L Li yes what the fuck is that
fuck okay so left macro we create a
variable variable then we count through
steps and then we we do we do a search
for TS we search for TS and then we
start doing some cursor right cursor
right delete anyway then we do some
deletes and stuff like that so this is a
I didn't want to do do you want to see
what it does well so it renumber x' all
the numbers it searches for TS so it's
kind of cool I'm not proud of I didn't
want to use it okay so let's go ahead
and modify it to you on delete the the
numbers I'm getting rid of the numbers
because I have obviously
when I started I was lazy I didn't want
to put all the strings but in the end I
I put all the strings so it's kind of uh
can we modify this or this just do it
fuck this okay you know we're gonna do
okay so Dilbert the manager you don't
want to sleepwalk okay
so ctrl F let's see here's what we do we
say F to record there's 73 of them right
so um ctrl F yes right right right so
you can when you make a macro it will
reproduce it for you I'll show you show
you that in a second
okay so we just deleted so we stop the
macro I don't know if you have to press
stop and now let's put 172 of them
getting exact and then repeat n times oh
fuck
the fuck
oh it did it oh damn I thought it was so
it so it worked
however it
it froze the why is that da why is that
teacher there the fuck
oh that's fine okay why didn't you use a
global variable huh
too proud to use a global variable okay
that's fine okay so um too proud to use
a global variable okay oh fuck oh we
used to have them I have to make a
global variable fuck you fucking fuck I
just I think we used to have a global
variable so the reason we can't use the
progress global variable is because um
some applications will clobber the
progress bars so we have to recreate
them every time okay so why not you want
to use a static look no again he's just
daddy there used to be a start-up 40s
okay
so we want to say testsuite
- sweet fuck
so we just got rid of I
this wheat I plus plus oh you know let's
use a global variable just wheat what
are you why did I do that why the fuck
did I do that
okay so now are you serious I can't
believe I had to fucking do that okay
this week t0 this week
okay so Gilbert
being a bosses
okay so here's what we do you say if to
record
and we say
f3
okay so now we say we want to play up
172 times so this part I don't have
preemption and so it freezes Oh didn't
freeze okay
okay so
sometimes I like to imagine that my
operating system will be used for 2,000
years into the future and that each of
these characters is important because it
will be uploaded and transferred okay
I think I had
sometimes it's weird why the fuck did I
have that t0 I think it's just because I
didn't want to use a global variable
fuck
what
one seven seven six
so um you might ask why am i doing these
test Suites um you know quite honestly
the more you run it the better my
operating system is fucking rock-solid
the only way to get that is to
aggressively chase bugs actually I
shouldn't say that you know if I
interrupted in the middle of this
there's a chance that would cause some
corruption okay I don't try to I don't
try to make my operating system fail
what do I mean I don't I don't do things
in the background and interrupt them and
do stuff I kind of treat my operating
system with kid gloves well that's kind
of ironic anyway anyway uh so
maybe I need to spend some time being
for being a brutal user interrupting it
and doing shit you know the reason that
I don't is because uh we're not we're
not trying to make it Titanic we're
trying to make a kayak
you know what kayak is designed to be
reinstalled I can reinstall in five
minutes so
nevertheless
I know
some things are off limits when it comes
to our what I expect out of my operating
system you know I let Linux is a semi
truck with 20 gears if you think about
file permissions and stuff Windows is a
passenger car in Temple os is a
motorcycle so with the motorcycle if you
lean over on a motorcycle it will crash
anyway
should I put tap in here anyway so that
macro that I used to have here renumber
was a good sometimes you want
demonstrations or examples it served as
a a pretty good
I think I'm gonna regret this
it served as a pretty good
you know I have to make demonstrations
of features and stuff that renumber
macro is pretty slick but it's better if
you don't need it obviously so I was
lazy I didn't want to type all those
strings in the beginning
so when you're the manager
a young engineer is likely to uh not
keep it simple
an old engineer keeps it simple
and
so I kind of
I don't like Dilbert I keep hoping that
I'm going to be impressed with like
really clever comics where the manager
is actually the smart one
Dilbert would be a lot better if the
manager was actually the smart one in
that that would be an awesome comic if
they did that they don't do that right
when I was well obviously when I was
young I didn't quite understand
clever
anyway they should have made Dilbert the
smart one very I mean the boss is Marwan
know
let's go look at some Dilbert Cummings
let's see how long it takes to find one
where the boss is unintentionally the
smart one I found a couple where the
some people might
some people might be disgusted Terry you
know why you liked the boss because
you're a loser no I'm actually an
awesome engineer
so
if I had a job I guess I would be the
pointy hair boss wouldn't I
that's who I would be if I had a job
there would be some punk some punk who
keep it fucking and simple fucking
nigger I'm not impressed
yes I would be the point of your boss
so let's go see how long it takes to
find an example where the boss is
actually the smart one
this is working out better than I
thought so I was going to use the I have
the ability to use the ican unassembled
code I thought I could do something
tricky
I didn't want to put those those strings
I was going to use the caller and then
do some unassembled but then I realized
I didn't have the unassembled doesn't
have the strings in in this case the
unassembled doesn't have the strings if
you see these files already see this do
main compiler if we put the call to TS
inside of this function then we could we
could that's that's another option we
could put the call to TS inside this
function and then we could use the the
unassembled and what would we see when
we unassembled the caller the caller's
name would be mini compiler and then we
can get to string so if we put the TS
into the function but anyway as you can
see um where you what if we used the in
this TS file we could extract the string
and set TS so there i wanted to get
clever i could anyway
but I think we set off for this
I already fucking typed I already
fucking typed all the strings it's not
too bad making a new entry you know how
many
how often how many more examples are we
going to add probably not too many I
need to uh what I want is I probably put
some work into cult
I need to cull that's my favorite word I
need to cause some some redundant
examples oh I know it's going to say so
there's a steer at Syracuse the Catholic
book in the Bible right and Sirach is a
Catholic only book and they have a
there is a form of shrewdness which is
thoroughly bitter I think that's the
greatest quote there is a form of
shrewdness which is thorough thoroughly
bitter
and keep it simple is bitter deleting
work that you've already done is bitter
there is a form of shrewdness
it's just thoroughly bitter so I can
swear it so I got the Surat I have a
this is a Catholic Bible I don't have
the King James I like the King James
because it says Oracle
so
I used to do random I don't use that
Bible very often I do all my stuff
online with the King James but some of
the pet some of the passages stuck with
me there is a form of shrewd you know
what the best line is it is not for a
man buckling his armor to boast as
though he were taking it off it is not
for the man that is the most badass it's
not for the man buckling his armor to
boast as though he were taking it off I
can't believe that's that's the most
badass fuckin I can't believe that's not
in a movie it's not for the men buckling
his armor to boast as though he were
taking it off
so
so running the test suite is not a waste
of time because that's what it's for
do you see you see how it never caused
it you see how you never get any bugs
when you run it and it's because I ran
it a lot
there is a form of shrewdness that is
thoroughly bitter so let's go look at
some Gilbert comics
okay escape so
that was can the cargo cult this was
cargo cult why do you have the number
and the reason I had the number is
because when it was running in it
crashed I had a hard time finding
finding which which it was oh and we
don't want cargo cult
and
we don't want cargo cult
and
I like to
I like to be brief
if he can say it in
and I think I get off on I get off on
short choppy B Metallica so I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be a Dilbert boss when do you
write beat Metallica so what do I mean
by B Metallica let me show you when you
in everything you do
payment be Metallica what I mean I mean
look at some of these they they talk in
short how do you describe it short sharp
words you know Trump is uses simple
words what's a good example
they use vivid bodies fill the fields I
see hunger euros and no one to play
soldier now no one to pretend running
blind through killing fields bred to
kill them all
victim of what said should be a servant
until I fall soldier boy made of clay
now an empty show twenty one holy son
but he served us well bred to kill not
to care you see I don't do eggs bred to
kill you know what these are short sharp
powerful sentences not to care - just as
we say finish here greetings death he's
yours to take away back to the front
Bheema delegate you won't understand
until you're older so it doesn't do any
good okay so let's go up should I put
that in my policy so now I'm a manager
okay
user
when you write a song
so we're gonna do exercises where you
have to write songs because it teaches
it teaches you something
Beeman delica you know what when I was
young I used to write paragraph or big
long emails like a page of tedious text
and a manager would look at it for a
second and then do it one sentence
answer for sentence fragment answer I
was like dude I wrote you a whole page
of beautiful grammar sentences and you
give me this sentence fragment answer
what the fuck so
let's go look at Dilbert let's go see
how long does it take to find one where
the boss is the smart one yeah I found a
couple dude you should totally do that
now I sort of despise these
whoa
so I'm gonna be the pointy-haired boss
that's my new
I think stuff like this is hopeless you
can't just tell them being Metallica's
let's gonna get some ramen delegate
no I don't even know that's all
fortunately I know this song
I think he's Irish
do I know this off I don't love this
song
the horsemen are drawing near on leather
steeds they write they've come to take
your life on through the dead of night
with the four horsemen ride or choose
your fate in dice
so when Teleca uses simple words not
pretentious they're sharp they're really
sharp this one I would say they're sharp
they're sharp be Metallica simple words
sharp
so
what other pointing here boss things can
we make up so um I think I decided I
don't want employees it's fucking up
it's difficult keeping myself occupied
you think I'm joking I'm not joking so a
person would naturally assume that I
have all kinds of work I should be doing
I've been changing this from silver to
gold and it was copper about ten years
ago about five years ago it was silver
and now I'm turning it into gold and
platinum okay so what other
Beamen Delhi so we have to find some
more of stuff to work on oh crap okay so
I I did some research on this on this
change disk thing and fuck let me show
you what we're talking about so
now I have to be a stud okay
so we're gonna install the distro inside
of us we don't have to do this
um change disk doesn't work there's a
simple workaround which is to remap
remount the cd-rom so what I could do I
don't want to do this so when you mount
a a senior oh you know what you know
what fucking
for ten years I used real hardware and I
learned a lot of lessons about real
hardware and I really don't want to fuck
with that code because I no longer have
real hardware to test it on the little
motherfuckers okay so you want to get
rid of CD ROMs right and then you know
what I have a native I have a computer
that runs natively and somehow somebody
fucking destroyed my CD ROMs like my dad
snuck into my room and fucking broke my
cd-rom drive I swear I'm not kidding umm
it's not the CD ROM it's the it's the
controller I think they fucking broke
the controller god dammit
when fucking Satan is chewing on your
nuts that's when you fucking that god
damn it anyway so fucking Satan and shit
so
so then let me explain
so watch this
I'm going to install from one cd-rom and
then change the cd-rom and then try and
install another CV wrong but that but
the the change just doesn't work in qemu
but it works in vmware but if you do a
mount operation then it works so what I
could do is every time you want to all
holy fucking shit goddamn I have a
vision in my head
Wow okay so check this out what if you
hit one command and it takes a whole
cd-rom it remounts it and copies the
whole cd-rom on your hard disk that's
why I make the big bucks that's why I'm
fucking god okay so
holy fucking shit
okay so when currently you have to
remount you have to do this let me just
show you out instead of keeping you in
suspense every time you want to change
you need to remount you need to create a
new what this does is a hardware reset
we're gonna say T probe 2 and then so
that remounts the drive and then you say
change disk oops I did did that wrong so
um
you want to know why I made the big
bucks what if I make a
when you hit a key is any copies the
entire cd-rom into a temporary directory
called cd-rom
the question is do we allow any other
access
if you have big balls you say no that is
deep that is the only way you use it I
think we're gonna do that that's what
we're gonna do so I'm gonna tear up all
my code so that the only way you use a
cd-rom is you hit one button it remounts
it and a REIT copies it onto your hard
disk in a certain directory a cd-rom
directory that's how the senior arm is
gonna work and you're not going to
access it
some people will complain and say yeah
but you should make it so that you can
have a No
you know random access to your CD ROMs
know what if I well what if I copied the
ISO I copied the whole fucking so that's
why I make the big books let's see
so I have an ability to mount an ISO you
want to know why I make the fucking big
bucks tell you why it fucking make the
big Bush okay so drive
you want to know why I make the big
bucks okay so we have some ISO is here
right what we're gonna do is reading
that we're gonna make a command so that
so that the only way the cd-rom works is
it copies the whole disk into a local
ISO and then we're gonna make okay so
you can mount an ISO
how do you do that I forgot oh I know
who did we say well we say I yourself
read drives a file name
can we hit f4
okay so now the M Drive is the ISO so
the only thing the hardware is going to
be capable of doing is copying from the
disk to an ISO file okay
do we want to do that what how much
would it simplify stuff so we're making
okay so the reason I make the big bucks
is because we're not making an ordinary
conventional operating system we're
making we want to cherry-pick we want to
make something that is different and why
is it why does it have value if I can
remove complexity so that the only way
to use a cd-rom is to grab the whole ISO
that's what we want to do okay so
the only cd-rom there are two cd-rom
commands read iso and right iso and
perhaps we don't even have a a drive oh
except when we boot we have to boot to a
cd-rom
so what am I talking about over here you
can't change disk it needs a hardware
reset when you do a mount it does a
hardware reset let's see if we can
identify it what the exact problem is so
that we could fix it like a white man
let's see okay so there's a there's a
reset command
maybe we should issue that and see if
that does it and if that's the case then
we can put it into change disk look why
don't we do that okay and I already know
it's broken I'm gonna save you some
suspense and fucking try and fix it so
we go - oh fuck
okay
things happen for a reason
things happen for a reason and not
always but anyway so if we go to the
colonel let's go to uh
and we're going to issue a reset to the
hardware every time you do a change disk
and let's see if that fixes it here's
the problem I don't have a real cd-rom
anymore and therefore if I make a change
then I could be breaking something that
already worked if I make a change I have
a lot of value because I did testing on
real hardware and it's kind of like that
asset is present in my code and if I
start changing it then then I might lose
lose the ability to run on real hardware
that's what's the analogy 488 and I
think this is what we wanna do
okay so should we just issue an 88 and
it I think this
I think this allocates a we don't have
an unlock we don't have an unbound
I think the read native max allocate say
a file information record okay let's see
if it works first 88 in it okay so we
know
this
we're gonna send a hardware reset to the
fucker
every time you do a change disk let's
see if that fixes it
okay so there is we have to unmount
let's just do this fucking okay
- okay
let's see if it works let's see if it
works right now okay first of all
control all - okay so we say change ID
do we have yeah okay good
ide1 all we have to see your own did he
give the file
so the reason I make the big bucks is
what if I make so that you can you issue
one command and it copies the cd-rom
into a local file the local directory
not just an ISO the one step would be to
make an ISO two steps would be to uh to
make it into a directory a local
directory hit a key and it grabs the
entire disk and puts it into a local
directory called funky so so we have the
hardware reset let's see if it works
change disk T okay
so you hit a key and it copies the
entire cd-rom into a into a directory
called cd-rom and then you can do this
so or we can just add this reset so the
reset is not good for multitasking let's
say you had two tasks that were
accessing the cd-rom and one of them
issues a hardware reset it's gonna fuck
shit up okay now let's see let's see if
we fixed it so if we fixed it and it's
gonna allow us to do it again before I
added that reset it would not allow a
second change disk let's see if I fixed
it
okay so ctrl alt T ctrl alt to now I say
DJ
how we see books one okay so one so
let's see the mount here's the big
moment of suspense did I fix it did I
fix it I fixed it I fucking fixed it god
damn I am smart okay fucking fixed it
trust me it was broken
okay so the question fucking so now the
reason I make the big bucks is because I
see new ways of doing it you hit a key
and it copies the cd-rom to a local drip
you just say cd-rom and then it copies
the entire cd-rom to a directory called
machines : / oh wow
so let's
we're gonna put this in our to-do list
because it's a brilliant fucking idea
maybe we beat until we have a committee
Beeman Teleca
okay I'm not gonna really
okay
okay so we have that as an idea
so
so now we have to we have to do this
right so
robustness is robust is king robust is
king so what is the correct answer I
don't know what is the fucking correct
answer I don't know this is not the
right answer this is not this is not the
correct answer but god damn its robust
as hell
this is robust as fucking hell so some I
think this copy let's see if there's
anything allocated that we need to free
before doing this
okay so we're what did you does reading
a reading in of Max does this allocate
anything I think somewhere in here it
allocates a sec to 512 byte information
sector where is that fucking information
sector
barking of machine-gun fire he used to
hear somehow the one do you play soldier
it device ID
I think this shit this allocates a block
ID we need to free this puppy
is that the okay we should make a of an
unmounting uninit okay
what's the opposite of an it in my
operating system clean up clean up is
the opposite of an it in my operating
system
one mount cleanup is the opposite what
do i what am I talking about in my
operating system in all of my games if
we take a game like this cleanup is the
opposite of in it and whenever we the
reason I make the big nut the big nuts
the big bucks is because unmount is what
a white person would say in my operating
system we use cleanup as the opposite of
an it if we have any other unmount do we
have any other examples where this okay
consistency is next to God godly
godliness should we read a policy clean
up is the opposite of an it okay no no
okay so
cleanup sounds nasty 88 cleanup what the
fuck
okay so these were originally not
designed to be remounted okay
so
what if I just free it oh damn I'm damn
I'm smart God you can't believe how
smart I am
I know why I'm a fucking genius I'll
tell you why I'm a fucking genius
okay
we are going to free the old one and
then mount a new one
so is blocked device allocated with zero
and I do believe the answer is yes but
there might be some cases were not so
okay so what is this faggotry what is
this faggotry here
what am I talking about what is this
faggotry
holy shit I free it
Wow I'm already a genius and I didn't
even know it
I free it
is there some reason that you
why do you pass this in there you
fucking nigger
it's fucking right there on their
fucking
look at this it's right there on their
fucking beady fucking nigger okay so
get device ID okay hold on
okay
shelf
eighty-eight device ID
is that the only thing
these Jesus fucking shit oh we don't
want to get it there
probe why don't you just put it on
okay no we're gonna do here we never set
to 0 and we doing
good device ID
okay that's why
okay you're forgiven you are forgiven
for what if we just say don't allocate
fucking
that's what we did say
why don't you just say don't allocate
dev ID
okay so this causes it to free it
if ID record
we free it here
okay
oh yeah
these are returning
you would
No
here what if we
should we free it in all cases
fuck you're supposed to free it if you
this is the case
no you know what we do I tell you what
would you let me see
what the fuck are we doing anyway device
ID if error
I think we want to say no we're doing is
he
you want to do that
I like positive logic I like to put the
short thing first I like positive logic
not always but anyway
you know what as a matter of fact oh
never mind okay so you know what we're
doing is incredibly risky because
we should
if you don't do testing this shit is
really unpleasant to test damn it I
should just be extra careful
okay
so you want to see if it works
so here's the situation when I designed
my operating system originally I wanted
to allow two people to use the cd-rom
right now all hell would break loose if
two tasks were accessing the cd-rom and
one did a change disk but you have to
ask yourself what the foot okay I don't
I like being obnoxious but if I can do
it correctly I would prefer to do it
correctly
in other words if I could make it work
for two cd-roms two tasks using this
easier on I would prefer that but if I
have to be obnoxious it will okay okay
so is that the only thing allocated I'm
pretty sure that's that's the
interesting thing
I fucking wrote this code many many
years ago but the interesting thing is I
know exactly what I don't think there's
anything else allocated okay let's let's
review what could go so we're doing an
extra in it let's peek unlock doesn't do
anything read native max so we went to
the bottom of this
get device ID
what if there's something allocated
somewhere else
there's not we can look at the record
okay so let's look at the block device
record see if there's anything there
like 40 that's not allocated what about
clearing it out
should we set it to zero what about okay
when you start over
you start with everything zero so
technically if I if I reinitialize I
should set this to zero actually all of
these need to be set to zero don't they
fuck so in my
okay we're not doing a remount overdoing
is issuing a reset so never mind we're
not we're not doing a complete remount
we're just doing reinitialized hardware
so we're actually doing it a white man
way of doing it we just were just
issuing a reset okay in other words it's
not bad it's not that bad so if we were
gonna remount then we would have to
clean up all this shit but we're not
remounting all we're doing is issuing a
reset a hardware reset ok
well holy
so we have to test the hard disk in the
cd-rom
and I have to change the
okay
I
I did I did it and it worked okay so
there was some kind of bug which killed
it's on the video
here we don't have to reboot
as a matter of fact
these look very similar
enjoy it some other day okay so I guess
we say fix I don't feel I don't feel
good about this do I
sometimes maybe you would call it being
beating a gorilla oh hold on is fucking
second this is only if it's only only if
it's cd-rom do we want to do this damn
it
BD
why are you using reverse logic
oh that's why okay
you know what we didn't do this very
carefully
if removable
you know there's not any other
okay
done I'm done and one of the next one
done done under the next one
okay so hard disk works
so I should really be extra extra extra
careful I should be really extra careful
are you absolutely positively certain
and say you're 16 what the fuck is I you
did me a you 16 pointer pointer
what about any
what about in the
plot device structure is it a u16
pointer pointer okay
command
okay
is a black device ID
we need to look up bike vise and see if
it's a year 16
yes it is a u16 place a traitor
so
I changed the code I actually made it
more aligned more lines of code the
question is if I tell people to get rid
of lines of code is it going to cause
bad code well I'm the one in charge but
I would one time I said we don't care
about
I was just going to let people anyway if
they could reduce the lines of code in
any way they they could we would allow
it
I know
I would like to to allow any sort of
hack that reduces lines of code maybe I
don't want to do that because it would
be part of the fun to get rid of lines
of code technically when I changed it it
made it more of lines of code
yeah so Disick school might be watching
what
if physics rule is watching I have to uh
okay
five minutes Thank You mr. chairman uh
mr. Burson secretary Johnson is quoted
as saying if there were legal limits on
his ability to do some background
investigations I think that was a really
unfortunate phrase that he used but
unless you and I see if we can kind of
demystify that a little bit do you agree
that non-citizens who are not in the
United States are not afforded any
protections under the Fourth Amendment
that's my understanding
well you were a US attorney and you're
being modest not only is that your
understanding it's also though all the
Fourth Amendment does not apply to
non-us citizens who are not here anymore
than the Eighth Amendment applies to
non-us citizens who are not here would
you agree with me that there is no legal
bar to accessing data from non-citizens
who are not present in the United States
well you also agree with me that there
is no legal right to emigrate to the
United States it's a privilege that we
confer on people but it is that it is
not a right it's correct sir
so would you also agree that you can
condition the conference of a privilege
on just about anything you want so long
as you don't violate a treaty or or the
Constitution or the Constitution but you
made I'm sure extensive use of
polygraphs when you were the United
States attorney all right and they're
not admissible in court are they not
generally but we still use them because
they are a very effective investigative
tool do we use them in the vetting of
people who want to come here with regard
to immigration benefits I am not
familiar with the policy in the refugee
context we do not regularly use a
polygraph if there's significant doubt
in the operational component given the
border authorities that ice and CBP have
typically the decision would be made to
bar entry rather
to go to the extent of trying to
ascertain the veracity but but you and I
didn't just use polygraphs in our
previous lives because we had doubt
sometimes it it and since the person to
want to embrace the truth when they
think it might be a threat that they're
gonna be polygraph
okay um I'm gonna shut down right now
bbl
wait let's let's go look in the chat
room first
okay I want to shut down`,

`okay we're good so
I installed wine the Windows emulator
and I'm running if you go to my site and
you type files you can download sim
structure sim structure set up that's a
Windows application and you can I wrote
this in 2000 2001 2000 2001 so I want to
check something
this is a big test
so
there's a bouncy ball where is it
there we go okay so I want to test this
in sim structure check out how high
these different balls bounce the
basketball the super bouncy ball and the
golf ball now I'm gonna try the golf
ball on top of the bouncing ball on top
of the basketball and then I'm gonna
explain how it's relating to a supernova
probably not okay so let's make some
bouncy balls
okay wanna reset
so I think is there a snap oh no anyway
oh no what if it doesn't work okay let's
see
I think it failed
you can set the hardness I don't think
that's you know matter oh I know what
let's let's sit the simulation to higher
tire
dang I could swear there was a that I
did that I could swear I did that as an
example I guess not so um
this is this is flooding potential and
kinetic energy and total energy and it
does a pretty good job of conserving
energy which is a sign that the
simulation is good but it didn't do the
bounce correctly that sucks
so
I'm a day
so
this is for designing I wrote this
program I wrote this program so that I
can design control systems and not have
to build expensive motors and stuff so
you can you can pick this up
this used to be pretty impressive I
wrote this in 2000-2001 but now they
have Grand Theft Auto and it has a
compiler actually it's an interpreter so
for the control system you have genes
and I just monkied together a control
system PID controllers and stuff anyway
let's do a let's do a rocket
oh there's a reset
what is why isn't it
damnit
I can swear there was a hmm oh wow this
door rocket so
you are
put a thruster
and
okay so
the reason sim structure is a good
program is because boy it's been a while
particle to you
you can see
thruster one thrust equals
Lester won the rest of unsaturation
thrust times p2y about 30 - P - why
these are five units now
okay so this is what's called a well
it's oscillating
[Music]
now let's let's add a derivative
Plus let's see 0.001 particle 1
derivative in the Y so we're adding
particle 1 we probably want to subtract
a thousand
okay let's do more than
a hundred
okay
I don't know if it's making a difference
let's we should say p2
okay that makes a difference okay so now
we're it's
too much gain so zero point
okay so
so what we should do is
Oh
oh that was dumb okay so we have a
proportional and a derivative I'm going
to decrease the gain on the
you might ask why we have the
steady-state error that's because we
need to make an integrator I think you
can say Doughboy
so here so this was my first it was an
interpreter it's not a compiler
[Music]
PID stands for proportional integral
differential
so we're gonna make it let's see if I
can remember so error is equal to why
okay
now we say integrator
hi
now that will
this will integrate that error
now it it should to drive the error to 0
0 steady state error
oh we overshot
it's going to take a long time
so now we want to
it's increased differential
I don't think we want to overshoot so
much
well wait a minute I think we want the
other the other answer
it's
too much derivative
whoo oh no too much integrator
and we can plot the
if you say signal I do believe this one
Louise have to have sleep lot okay then
we have to see applaud you can see
okay
Oh
you
it's been three or four years since I
use this
damnit
actually I have this source good I wrote
it okay anyway all we can look at a
different example so let's let's file
save as now what the heck
rocket now let's be open
I think the
one of these has a
one of these has applied
oh this does
okay
so we go to
[Music]
a man window whoops
Oh
what
it had a plot it's not quite working
right it's got bugs didn't have
maybe that's because
I had the window open
so what just want to release anger to
three
anyway
out there we go okay so how do we whoops
there we go
you say signal do you assign and then
you just say plot okay
[Music]
no we open
rocket
-
okay so now you can see the error we
overshoot
okay so if you overshoot you want less
gain or more derivative the derivative
subtracts
okay that's really bad I think we have
too much integrator
oh you crashed
oh well
oh well that was some structure that's
what I did before templo s
so
I put the engine from sim structure into
Diplo se
for example
struck
so strut is uh
these are masses in Springs
the the connector is a member that will
break it'll break when you press that
key
thruster to you thruster one the rest of
three
okay so this is in Diplo s now I can
press one like your breath too
so
the code is all there
let's talk to God
- remember this program this program
reads the three gigahertz time stamp
count and then prints a random word
Prince of prints a word based on the
timer
Grouse
so we got some geniuses do we
so
I want to
honey we can new dude
Oh
I'm not much of a Linux expert
what the fuck
now on I foot
okay so
so see this time
now that's pretty fucked up
okay
I hit that bug before
why wait a minute email move what why is
it
any idea why it's not listed
Oh
oh it's in tad desktop okay everything's
clear
I have to copy
now I have to lease
and
do you think FC wined I just look I just
installed wine for the first time
well that let me say wine
what did it do
it's clicking
there's
the hood
flashed really fast okay sua CD
hey maybe I can click on it how do you
get it to show hidden directories in
this
oh I didn't put it in do you think it
needs quotes probably now that I think
about it
oh good
I think that's what I did the last time
oh okay
so just to be clear
okay
we probably need quotes
see how it works
okay how about no quotes
I don't know I'll work on it some other
time
any Linux experts so so this this is um
you can control the angle of the
thruster if you one angle for equals now
there's a Oh about P 2 X minus P 1 dot X
so now we're gonna probe okay it went
the wrong way
you wanna explain I speak to it
let's make it more gentle we oh there's
there's a heading okay we'll do that
so
now this is rocket science okay so
there's a spin okay first of all there's
the heading
I think it's a pie times
they're called bonds and particles
instead of masses in Springs don't ask I
didn't like the word member I was
thinking of members and so bonds and
particles you can put electrostatic
forces
I think we want unwrapped
I call it unwrap that that was on the
steak instead of wrap wait let's just
convert
didn't you slower keys baby I got it
yeah he's Laura gates okay
please
he doesn't appear to be doing anything
seems to be zero bond heading I think
you want to say
[Music]
let's put it on the screen I don't
remember how
okay
Oh
okay it's to its degrees
it's degrees so we see
I think there's an error
here it
oops damn
Oh Shi
I think how do you
shit
let's put this
this is interesting
step function
so it's
hovercraft
okay
what was the error
warning text even time identifier okay
oh so you
okay
so you might ask what are we doing this
is not see if it's uh is this a function
or what is this what this is is uh
statements they get integrated to get
executed every time it I don't know what
is it
statements that get executed every time
it calls the integrator call back anyway
if you put you can make things execute
on a schedule like every tenth of a
second
these ad signs make it make it execute
when it plots it on the screen so
the a variable all okay that's a one
time
it's coming back to me I wrote this a
long time ago okay so
okay star on signed
okay now we have the controllers
so there's a spin which is the
derivative of the heading
okay notice how now it's
we have a controller
okay so you can't know you can make it
go to an XY anyway I've showed what I
wanted to show
okay so now I wanted to make the
winnings
what is this
Oh
so
I'm just checking if I have the standard
yeah
so in my bin
we would see wine
Oh
so
Oh
mr. striker
hey it works
okay now
okay now
oh we have to see
okay
now
coppy
go to desktop
delete that
peace now
hopefully
shit
let's go to
they stopped
Oh
what are these look like
Oh
the other answer okay so now we go to
okay this is
okay now
copy
Desktop
beast
damn
dad
see
what did that do
oh okay now I know the problem okay
there we go okay just
they're okay
now
well
I would enough for`,

`okay so at school
Russian College presents the making of
medieval illuminated manuscripts by dr.
Sally dormer the beginning well I am
game since the first inning he's talking
about how medieval illuminated books
were made there are a multitude of ways
you can take very broad approaches and
think about if you like patronage
functions or you can be much more
focused in your approach
as a matter of fact I was born I was
born in 69
okay so
so let's do some assembly
so these are the 64-bit registers
there's 16 if you count them
I'll give you a quick lesson in assembly
language so a register is is like a
variable it's kind of like an integer
variable a lot of I'll assume you've had
some programming on the Commodore there
was a an accumulator you used to do
stuff like load a 10 and a 20 or
something like that so you put 10 into
the accumulator and then you might add
20 to the accumulator and then you might
do something like store a at a memory
pointer something like this
the Commodore had in a and then it had
an x and a y but mostly you did it with
the a register you did everything with
the a register it was kind of like you
had one variable and you had to shove
everything in and out of it do all
operations on it well on the x86 our ax
is your a register and it's kind of
Oh
some some architectures every register
is identical but on the x86 the
registers have certain usage RA X is
some instructions only work on re X this
is kind of the this is the accumulator
when sometimes you do a 128-bit
operation and so sometimes they'll you
will you will pair up sometimes our ax
will be used along with RDX sometimes
these two are used together okay and our
BX is there I think there's one special
instruction but for the most part our BX
is just it's just another accumulator
that it doesn't quite it's not quite as
good an accumulator as our ax but it's
kind of like this is uh this is pretty
generic and then there's our CX now this
is uh you can do everything you can do
with our BX you can use it as a generic
but this one is special because it's for
looping and stuff like that
it's the count it's it's kind of an
account register okay and then you start
getting into RSI and RDI
now these now here's the deal
in the later models they did away with
some of the special-purpose things kind
of got a little bit less special-purpose
they started making the special-purpose
instructions slow as a matter of fact
the special-purpose instructions are
kind of slow so what I'm talking about
is
like Luke there's a loop instruction
some of these things they made them slow
in any way the the RSI and RDI are used
for like load string constant but these
are this is the source and this is the
destination these are kind of like
pointer registers and some operations
this this is this will load a byte room
into it's already next but we'll just
say you start getting these uh this is
kind of like saying a equals if you know
and if you know see there are some
instructions that lets you do stuff like
this I equals source plus plus there's
an instruction that says star
destination plus plus equals star source
plus plus that would be move string
constant byte anyway so we're sort of
getting a little bit sidetracked so
these are si and are di are kind of like
pointers I guess you could say they're
for string operations it's not just
strings and now we started getting into
they sort of did away with this special
purpose okay RBI is the stack frame
tweener
what you do is in the past all arguments
to functions were were pushed on the
stack and when you access them you would
use the rbp and it used to be important
because there was something called
segmentation and SS used to go off of
rbp but things have gotten a little bit
simpler and as a matter of fact it's my
understanding a lot of people don't
really even don't don't use our VP
anymore which what I use it for is for
whenever you access an argument to a
welke you always start I can still hear
my instructor saying push BP move BP
comma SP I had
movie become on HBO okay so every
function you might as well do this as
out of habit huh I'm not going to teach
you assembly I'm just gonna get you
started just realize that our BP is used
for uh for accessing local variables
then arguments off the stack so those
are the purposes of the registers now
they added another eight registers and
they might seem like they're no purpose
but as a matter of fact they they they
have some of the way there they're the
way they're encoded they're there
they're close relatives to the upper
eight are close relatives to the lower
eight and although I don't think you
don't have to worry about that very much
when you're writing a compiler you have
to worry about it but because the way
you access them is slightly different
anyway
so as it turns out what they in the past
when you wanted to access an art when
you wanted to get a function parameter
you might do something like this eat off
of but now what they now what they just
do it's my understanding that they just
used the RSP now you might say something
like they might do something like that
they go right off of that anyway so
that's kind of an introduction

gonna be standing right here George is
going to introduce tonight's speaker who
is done a young well 31 year old guy
named Don Knuth and that young guy is
going to be I stand here that's who I am
I think so
all right now so so this whole this
whole thing started with the Stanford
has a project going on for some years
called class X and the people the idea
is to make interesting videos to put on
YouTube for the future and so that
things that are going on these days at
Stanford can be appreciated by people in
future generations so they so they asked
me you know what I you know the tape
some kind of a presentation for the
future and I said well I would be fun to
do something different and that would be
to to try to repeat the first lecture
that I that I gave
laughter I've been a become a professor
at Stanford this was you know I I had
just become me my title changed from
mathematician to computer scientist and
so on
and and at that time as you see I wanted
to explain what it was what that's what
I expected I might be doing the rest of
my life to the to the people around so
so that's the beginning of this of this
talk and so it was November 4th 1969
that was that was a Tuesday and and I in
order to be a little bit on CENTAC I
decide I went over to the gap and I
found out that they are selling 1969
blue jeans so I bought myself
okay and also believe it or not I'm
wearing a wig and the reason is just to
help me remember that when I do give the
lecture that I got expected much as I
can't as I would have spoken to 60 now
if you want to see what I really looked
like Nabi updates building the first
floor there's a really nice historical
all right so so now in order to prepare
for this I got eye opal but by the way I
you know I came to Stanford because it
was the world's greatest computer
science department by father when he by
any measure and I mentioned joint
foresight the chair well he had he had
worked very hard all through the six
feet to build up this department and I'm
actually open in 1965 and and so this
was the place where I could come in and
and be have all the great professors in
one place instead of having to be an
isolated sense
so I guess I'll show off a little bit
well you should go learn holy see since
it's from God

okay fuck I have a video but nobody's
gonna watch it so here's the deal
in 2004 I resurrected I had a in 1993 I
had a real mode program that changed
there was a DOS program in assembly it
changed to protected mode it did a
little bit more I think I had a little
task scheduler like we did in school in
school we did it we did a desk scheduler
on an 8-bit and a lot of people you'd be
surprised I've met a lot of people at
Stanford say how can how can you run
multitasking without paging you get a
lot of people that say how can you run
multitasking without paging well I can't
you're a retard okay fuck you if you
have a problem with multitasking without
paging fuck you you're a retard okay so
as a matter of fact there was a guy at
MIT that said yeah I saw this really
stupid project that had code executing
on the stack and I got to thinking to
myself hey you know what if I do an
address map of my system um I don't
really use paging I do an address map
you know what uh there's a matter of
fact most of my a lot of my functions
are at the rate at the range 7ff see
I'll bet that retard and my teenager
thought that was stack okay that's a
that MIT nigger thought that 7f was
stack going well that's pretty stupid
and I'm not using paging duh
and you see what I'm saying he's going
well obviously you can't do multitasking
without painting them what we did that
in school on a little 8-bit processor
what the hell are you talking about we
had a little 8-bit Motorola processor we
we did multitasking we had we had to set
it up so that it ran a task at a certain
time it's like for your microwave oven
you know I'm all tied asking like for a
microwave oven he's like well you can't
do multitasking if you don't have paging
I'm going what so I I do I didn't want
to use paging but I had I set it up
identity mapped but anyway so first of
all no address is special just get as a
matter of fact I'll tell you right now
the first okay so in the x86
architecture with the 64-bit you can do
an instruction like this oh is it good
okay you can do an instruction like this
see they do have a 64-bit instruction
with an immediate like that but as a
matter of fact if you want to if you
want to store our ax like this let's
let's go ahead and see how this works
we're gonna run assemble here so this
instruction is it is 64 bits this
instruction is has a 32 bit this value
right here is 32 bits as a matter of
fact they don't have a 64 bit they don't
have a 64 bit all they have is 32 bit
now that's that's a minor inconvenience
but here's where it gets really bad
let's say you want to call
I'll just tell you
I'll just tell you I am good
so I'll fuck you
so in the x86 architecture there is a
32-bit relative call with a 32-bit
offset in order to do a 64-bit call you
have to do two instructions like this to
do a 64-bit okay so now if you remember
Bill Gates everybody made fun of him
because he said 640k ought to be enough
and now now all the kids say uh we're
not that stupid
of course it's never enough everybody
knows that's stupid that it's never
enough every every every kid is saying
they make fun of Bill Gates and they say
huh we're not that stupid we know it's
never enough okay it's never enough
Bill Gates was such an idiot he thought
6:40 would fix 40k was enough well did
you know that they pretty much stopped
at about eight gig they there's really
nobody really wants more than eight gig
right nobody really wants more than
eating yeah I think they do have more
now I have a 128 gig but uh pretty much
they they don't you don't really need
more than eight gig at least no nobody's
found a way to use it except for servers
with disk cache and stuff so it gig well
what do you know there really is a limit
you know back when they were making fun
of Bill Gates everybody thought there
was no limit so they what do you know
people six eight gig is pretty much all
you need well as a matter of fact when I
made this operating system first of all
it's a toy ok I make no no apology it's
a toy okay second of all you know it if
they stopped at eight getting
you know to 2gig is all you need for
code you know and that's really that's
really not not a that's really not a
sacrifice if if you limit it to two gig
then it's really not a sacrifice you
don't even have to call it a toy
operating system anyway what I did is I
limit it to two gig the code I limit to
two gig so I have what's called the data
heap which is the total and then the
code heap is that is two gig so my
operating system is ring zero only so I
never use and I don't use software
interrupts because those mess with
privilege levels and stacks and stuff I
don't use software interrupts I don't
use this enters this exit I don't I
don't do any of that all I do is call
32-bit the only no matter what whether
I'm calling operating system routine a
kernel routine I don't really have a
kernel I call it the kernel because
everybody wants to call it the kernel
but as everything is ring zero it's just
like the 8-bit in school in school we we
made a multitasking 8-bit scheduler in
school we made it multitasking 8-bit
scheduler and this is exactly the same
thing this is this is its ring it's only
one privilege level it's I don't really
use the paging I have an identity mapped
so it's it's pretty much like you're not
using paging there's our there's an
exception I a Lea Saul the hardware up
to four gig so when you want to do
uncashed hardware you access to alias
that's it makes me a little bit sad
because a lot of the old people remember
a zero zero zero zero for VGA and so
they come in here and they poke the a
zero zero zero and they want it to work
and it doesn't work they have to access
the alias and that makes me sad because
that was the whole purpose was to uh was
to was to get get to get people back on
the land
to get people back on the land anyway so
uh so the only call I use is 32-bit so
as a matter of fact I have to the first
tube gig of memory is called the code
heap and then the rest is the data heap
don't worry I can use if you want to see
me use you know 64 gig I can do a
demonstration anyway so uh how did the
way you the way you access data heap
memory is with malloc
when you say malloc that will fetch some
data heap now since I'm not using the
stack since I'm not using the paging
there is a major problem if you're not
using paging and then what that problem
is is growing the stack this this is the
this is a huge problem okay so we have
to declare how big a stack ahead of time
and that's a huge problem so well one of
the things you learn in computer science
is if you have a limit of a thousand
it's pretty much the same as if you have
a limit of 3,000 the only thing that
makes a difference is if you have no
limit if you have no limit that's you
program in a certain style if you have a
limit of a thousand you program in a
different style and pretty much one
thousand or three thousand it's about
the same I shouldn't have said a
thousand I have I have a limit of 128 K
for the stack you might say well why
don't you have so much memory once you
can make one Meg well the the honest
truth is it's really not gonna make a
difference if you have 128 K or 1 Meg I
mean at the as soon as you have a limit
it's all pretty much you're pretty much
in the same boat so I said a little bit
of 120
kay for the stack so what does that mean
that means you can't do lopsided binary
tree recursion you can't go you can't go
you know five Meg deep on the stack and
recursion so it's it's a really huge
problem but you know if you remember the
Commodore 64 it really it really wasn't
used by the what do we want to say
there's kind of there's a modern
programmer and then there's an
old-school programmer the old-school
programmers were good at assembly and
stuff the modern programmers are good at
algorithms and stuff in the old school
days you really didn't deal with
algorithms not very often you were more
concerned with the nitty-gritty of the
tedious stuff you didn't get as much
done I guess but you were you understood
a lot better about what was going on
so temple OS is wants to be like a
Commodore 64 and the things you did with
a Commodore 64 that's what you want to
do with temple OS so on a modern
computer that modern the modern kids
today maybe you might think they learn
how to do artificial intelligence and
you know fancy algorithms and stuff the
old-school programmers instead of being
instead of knowing what order of
algorithms were they knew what assembly
was and they knew they knew how to
encode assembly they knew how to run the
debugger they knew they knew how to do
system calls they do know how the disk
worked they knew how how the the serial
port worked like an old-school
programmer knew how to write to
interrupt routine okay a new a new
programmer knows how it knows what
order algorithm a you know heapsort days
or something in the old days what you
learned this how to write and interrupt
routine in the new days you learn what
order algorithm a heapsort is that's
kind of the difference in the old days
you learned how to write an interrupt
routine in the new days you learned what
what Big O order he pet algorithm is and
so it's kind of a it's a different
knowledge base so is this is the old
stuff irrelevant well you're gonna get
into trouble if you get too too clueless
you know I just had an analogy the other
day let's pretend you're swimming in the
deep ocean and you really don't know
what's underneath you you have no idea
what's underneath you well that's kind
of the situation of a modern programmer
they're in the deep ocean there they're
doing a a web application and it's so
far down to the bottom hardware the
hardware is at the bottom of the ocean
and when you're in the middle of the
ocean boy is you're a long way from
anything called hardware in the old days
it was kind of like a shallow lake and
you walked on the bottom and you weighed
it out in the in a little pond and
that's how you that's how you lived you
walked on the bottom of a muddy pond and
you had your feet on the hardware and
you knew you knew what was underneath
you you know is that it's a it's a
completely different feeling it's a
different feeling when you're in a pond
and you have your feet on the bottom or
a swimming pool you know I don't that's
a little let's let's say let's say a
pond or you have your feet on the bottom
it's a it's a different it's
qualitatively different than being in
the middle of the ocean where you have
absolutely no idea what is underneath
you you're just you know a modern
programmer there they're dip shits they
have no idea like did you know I'll bet
if you did buzz if you did buzz fizz a
moderate programmer would say you know
count mod six an old-school programmer
would say oh well we don't want to use
divide divide divide is 30 cycles and
decrementing a counter decrementing and
counter is you know one cycle so an
old-school programmer absolutely would
never use the divide its instead of a
decrement and that's the difference you
know it's kind of a joke
if you got an old-school programmer he
would use a counter he would say we're
going to count down to six for an
account down to seven of course we're
not gonna use a divider are you kidding
me why would we waste 30 cycles on a
divide
and that's kind of the difference in a
modern programmer an old programmer
the kids today they have no they have no
clue they're they're kind of completely
oblivious I don't think they teach them
that a divide is well maybe it's four
cycles today I don't know what's a
divide maybe four cycles compared to one
or something I don't know it's not like
the old ones so that's it's a different
it's a different kind it's a different
kind of knowledge it's a different kind
of knowledge and now so you will you
will never find you simply won't find a
modern programmer who why would you do
why would you do not count in one time
on our program it looks like that goes
what are you doing what are you doing
cannot modular 128 you know this is what
Knuth is a very as an advocate of
literate programming I say fuck that
fuck that what you want to do you don't
want to you don't want to change the
compiler for English what you want to do
is you want to educate okay one based is
definitely not correct you when it comes
to an array there's no question that you
want zero based and that's the way the
computer wants to do it the natural way
for for us an array is to use zero based
and if you're a French faggot you say oh
well well obviously it should start at
one I'll fuck you you're a French faggot
fuck yourself little arrogant fucking
French frog fucking array starting at
one fucking that's fucking ridiculous
okay another thing is a big Indian and
little Indian you know the French faggot
says well obviously we want it to start
with the big numbers first like that's
supposed to we'll fuck yourself a little
French faggot the computer wants to do
it little Indian okay little Indian is
obviously the way the computer wants to
do it okay fuck you and your french
faggotry some people want to do top-down
it's like fuck you why why do i why
would i declare a header for all these
functions does it really matter if it
comes first or second no that's just
French faggotry go fuck yourself do it
the way the computer wants to do it okay
do it with the you do bottom up okay you
do the little functions and then you
call the you call them what the big ones
that's the way the computer wants to do
it you're just you're just full of shit
if you're some French faggot that's
thing that thinks oh well there's a
there's a human way to do it I'll fuck
you the way you do it his way the
computer wants to do it you do zero
instead of a one array index you do
little endian instead of big endian
and you do it top you do it bottom up
obviously don't you know it's it really
it's not a hard conceptual problem for a
human as long as you have a way of doing
if yeah as long as you have a specific
way of doing it doesn't matter and some
people don't want to teach the kids like
they say oh don't tell them about and
127 no don't
they shouldn't learn that teach them
about modular and just tell them to do
modulo 100 don't don't tell them about n
127 tell them to do module 100 I'll fuck
you you know what you want to do is an
127 not modulo 100 they won't teach you
that I'm sure they won't teach you that
these are things they don't teach
anymore you know like a switch did you
know that a switch statement is do you
know what you know what the difference
in a radix sort in a comparison sort is
I swear to god this the CIA what a puppy
I support the CIA want the CIA wants to
deceive yeah the CIA wants to deceive
you so that you think that if else they
want you to think if else is the same as
switch and it's not okay it's the same
as radix sort versus comparison sort a
switch statement is a lot if you have a
hundred cases in a switch it's much
faster doing the switch then it is doing
a hundred if else it's completely
different okay
the switch is much faster switches order
one and the if-else is whatever order
and in some way
so these are the these are what the old
school people knew the old the old
school people knew like it
do they even teach which would you find
something like this today count and 127
would they understand what what's going
on here like how do you how do you a
line I would be how do you align to
eight byte boundary you know can you ask
can you ask a kid today how do you align
to an 8 byte boundary these are things
so what you would say is a pointer
equals what are we rounding up or down I
use for rounding up whatever let's say
pointer plus 7 and Tildy eight something
like that
that's rounding down whatever if you
wanna round up any way you can
these are these are this is the
information that they're not teaching
anymore so uh let's go let's go take a
peek
it has mine
source code is on every distribution but
I am very glad to report I made a
compiler fuck yourself I don't want it
on fucking faggot little computers fuck
the faggot little computers we want
fucking supercomputers Zeon are better
if I if it was up to me you had a Zeon
or better fuck this shit
ok Xena you have to have a Zeon that's
what I would say fuck you all the source
code is on every distribution you can't
get it without source code all it always
comes with source code all the source
code is on my website that makes me
giggle little motherfucker all my source
code is on my website you go right here
here's all the fucking source code right
there all the kernels right here you
want to see the curling if I can see the
kernel everything's here right on the
website go right to the website you can
go see the kernel you want to see the
scheduler here's a scheduler good look
good luck because it only compiles with
my compiler did I plan that in my no I
just I made a brand new awesome language
and what fuck it
you know what BAM
fuck you

so
so as a matter of fact I have a limit of
128k for the stack and I am so paranoid
about running out of stack that I do all
this to say Liz
this is a function string util and it
has it has a source and then it has
flags and will do
remove spaces this is a trick I learned
from taking that Ticketmaster
okay there's M string util string you
tilt string util operates in place on a
buffer so if you have a buffer and you
image if it shrinks in size you can do
it in place but a lot of times it might
expand in size we this is just an
example of a su su F let's remove space
you get single space you can remove
spaces this is a trick I learned that
Ticketmaster
let's just we're gonna say name okay so
this is a fairly typical operation in
temple OS you're you're you're
allocating a string off of this this
function returns an allocated string a
string is just a pointer to a u8 now
everything is unsigned we don't have
characters why would you have us why
would you this is insane in today's
world you have a 7-bit signed are you
fucking crazy why would you have a 7-bit
signed make it unsigned at least have it
unsigned so anyway we do what so we do
ctrl alt a this is the carrot there's
128 bits we're not doing Unicode we're
not doing Unicode fuck the Orientals in
their hieroglyphs
fuck you oriental people with your
dumbass hieroglyphs we're not fucking
doing hieroglyphs get the fuck out
nigger we're not doing fucking
hieroglyphs fuck you fucking get an
alphabet you fucking retard niggers
you're so smart fucking that hieroglyphs
fuck you in their hieroglyphs okay
fuck your hieroglyphs we do 8-bit ASCII
and so
we allocated and so I mean this is this
is a fun test okay so what's gonna
happen I'm gonna hit f5 and it goes from
this is a fun test this is a fun test so
what it did is it remove the spaces so
it allocated off of the heat this this
is a malloc memory Alec
mal LOC there's a there's a family
there's a family of allocates that are
malloc if I because I because I put a m
in front that's a malloc and then you
free it so notice notice I'm not using
you know I'm not using it on the stack
what a if you are if you were a normal
person today a normal person today would
do something like this do you know what
I'm saying this is what this is what a
normal person would do they would say
name to 256 they're using they're using
stack so first of all this is this is
faster but but look at this
as a matter of fact my my way of doing
it is actually kind of better you know
my way of doing it is actually kind of
better because this is a this is a
limited size we don't really want a
limited size as a matter of fact in a
nutshell that's how everything is in
temple OS we we never use a raise we
always do it dynamic and don't worry
about running out of memory we just let
it crash if anybody is so stupid as to
run out of memory
fuck them okay when
Linux is a semi-truck Windows is a car
in Temple OS is a motorcycle on a
motorcycle if you lean over it crashes
well don't lean over you just you don't
lean over on a motorcycle a motorcycle
does not have side impact airbags a
motorcycle does not have side impact
airbags well duh you know somebody's
gonna say it's not safe it can crash
that's ridiculous you have to have a
reset that's ridiculous
let's it's a fucking motorcycle fucking
nigger of course you don't have airbags
on a fucking motorcycle fucking retard
nigger so uh so we one of the things we
don't do is we don't check for
allocating too much if you run it out of
memory that's your own problem our our
philosophy is to keep the code simple we
don't we don't use a race we do
everything Malik ated arrays are for our
there's two problems with arrays first
problem is they use a lot of stack
second problem is they really do kind of
suck because they're they're not dynamic
you Yoma any any adult programmer wants
it dynamic any kid a kid likes fixed
arrays but fixed is really fucked
anything fixed is fucked
I'll get fuck all that okay it's a lot
better if you do it dynamic so in temple
os to do everything dynamic you don't
use the stack you use the heap use the
heap for everything you don't use the
stack and it's it's fine you can't you
can't unfortunately you can't really be
doing a it's not good for recursion I
don't know how to explain it but well
you should know you know if I tell you
there's a 128 K limit on the stack well
you can figure out pretty quickly that
it's not going to be my
fun for recursion because what if you
have a lopsided tree you know that's no
fun that's you know you can make a
balanced tree but it's really not much
fun if you've got to worry about
lopsided trees crashing it or something
anyway and imbalanced so you're saying
wow that's a major penalty well well the
truth is it's kind of for the same thing
you did with the Commodore 64 you really
didn't do the big recursion things on a
Commodore 64 you could I don't know it's
it's just for it's a different kind of
thrills it's a different kind of thrill
okay
so
so one of the things I learned that
Ticketmaster was was circular cues let's
just do a little quick example a
circular doubly-linked list now one of
the things I don't like is the standard
template library I don't like it let's
go
I don't know I'm kind of not I normally
have standard normally I have standard
where I call it SDR yeah so what we're
gonna do is and well what - let's do a
global variable what the heck we would
say W W this is fairly typical on the
Commodore 64 ever it was okay to use
Global's now here's the deal when you
scale a project up you have to do
changes when the project starts getting
really big like with a really big
project you can't be you can't have a
lot of global variables or the global
variables become a problem when you have
a really big project now what what
happens when you scale a project down so
on a big project you start shifting
stuff out of global variables into other
things okay and on a big project you
start using longer names you start
having multiple namespaces well this is
the correct way to scale a project up
well guess what when you scale a project
down you do the opposite on everything
so if we have so if we're if we're
telling a kid to write a thousand line
of code program first of all use global
variables of course you should use
global variables if the program is a
thousand lines of course you should use
global variables
that's ridiculous of course you should
use global variables do you need long
labels no you don't really mean long
labels if it's a thousand line program
if you don't worth W head is is okay you
know that's that's that's pretty good
and I guess so bird we're dead I used to
hate the word head but anyway
so you you could do this from scratch
but I have a little bit of support for I
don't have the full standard template
library but this will initialize a queue
and I might this might be how I do it
and so what we might do is Wow
well true I don't have continued I do
have go to I got really continued I
don't like continue anyway st equals
let's just use to get straight
we can just use get string by itself all
you want to say we're okay
so I don't remember if this returns null
I think it doesn't let's just that's
kind of overkill but if it's not if
that's no I don't think it returns null
oh why don't you what should we do if if
the first character is 0 and what do we
do we in temple OS you can free a null
it nothing happens if you free know that
that it's allowed as a matter of fact
it's it's guaranteed to be allowed this
kind of ugly so
we want to do Kelly why would you if
Kelly it's it's flirt its splurging a
little bit but you you quickly anyway
know what we're gonna do so we're gonna
steal that and not free it and we're
going to go ahead and say cue insert
okay so this is what we've learned the
backs the the the VAX that Ticketmaster
had in his head
atomic cue cue instructions for insert
and remove and stuff anyway let's go
ahead and say MW equals so we just put
them into a circular list and the way
you traversed once you get used to these
patterns you would call these
programming patterns
once you master these patterns it's
really nice once once you master these
patterns
you just have to master these patterns
they're very simple
just for uh
okay
we won't make some this is the this is a
pretty you will get used to this pattern
thanks Lee did I see oh well
okay do you see what I did here okay so
running main I'll get let's see if this
works okay this is a test you see what I
did it so it made a it stored them and
then printed them so you need to master
this this design pattern when you're
deleting first you look ahead before you
delete it and then you delete it and
then you and then you set it to the next
one now when you're doing multi-core you
have to be I guess you have to be
careful so you might ask why didn't you
use a linked list well the French people
like to like to use overkill and instead
of instead of instead of using a single
pointer I always use I almost always use
a circular doubly linked list do you
want to know why I'll tell you why
because very frequently I'll start with
this program and then it's like oh fuck
now we have to modify it and remove an
entry and if you if you went ahead and
did it with the you can remove entries
if you have the the doubly linked and
as a matter of fact at this point if you
really want to you can if you're using
doing multitasking okay so you can
remove it from the queue and then delete
it so this is the design this is the
main design pattern you use in temple OS
this is the main design pattern you use
there's a circular doubly linked list
allocated off of thing so instead of
using arrays don't use arrays
use these use these for everything
anyway
that's what I learned at Ticketmaster at
first I didn't like it because I thought
it was overkill and French I thought it
was kind of too French and overkill but
now I like you


the answer is no the answer is we don't
have operator overloading and that's
that's I don't like the standard
template library okay
legal is for cashing a EE I have a
circular doubly linked list that is what
I am using okay a circular linked list
can do everything a single linked list
can do but a circle can do a remove you
can remove in the middle of a circle so
just just use the fucking circles and
one of the things you owe you're always
gonna fuck up the a single linked list
or a stack you're always gonna fuck that
up because it's got a weird pattern for
if you do it this way you're gonna life
is gonna be a lot better for you then if
you use linked list
just do it always do it this way and
you'll never have to worry about it and
the design pattern is clean and
consistent and you're never gonna be
sitting there worrying about if you got
the head or the address of the head so
the answer is no don't do that
we're trying to be a Commodore 64 and
therefore if you use temple OS you will
know assembly you are walking in a pond
with their feet on the bottom of the
lake you're not in the middle of the
ocean
okay these faggots are in the middle of
the ocean they don't know what's below
them they kind of they kind of do stupid
things because they don't know what's
below
and you don't want to do recursion if
you don't have if you have a fixed stack
so just forget about it on here you can
do assembly okay that's
this this is a different sort of skill
there's a whole different look at it
this way you know everything that you
know about the internet was a matter of
fact everything you know about the
Internet is something Donald Knuth knows
about something different okay you you
if you spend 10,000 hours learning out a
program and 5,000 is the Internet then
somebody somebody like Donald Knuth
Knuth if they spend 10,000 then 5,000 is
not the Internet okay that's the way
this works if you spend 10,000 hours and
5,000 is the Internet then Donald Knuth
spends 10,000 hours and 5,000 is not the
Internet
okay do you catch my drift okay if you
spend $10,000 learning the program and
5,000 hours is learning about the
Internet
if Donald Knuth spends ten thousand
hours learning that a program five
thousand is not the Internet okay do I
make myself clear
okay listen little faggot have you ever
written a compiler have you ever written
them inner upper team a little faggot be
ever written an inner upper team a
little faggot no you haven't you're a
faggot
okay once you'll write an interrupt
routine faggot Pascal and you're fucking
in the ocean with some nigger in the
deep ocean you got no clue what's
underneath you little faggot once you
write an inter up your team this is an
inner upper team I wrote my own compiler
it has an interrupt keyword does house
ql does haskell have an interrupt
routine can you write an interrupt
routine in haskell with an interrupt
keyword huh can you write it interrupts
14 and ask what do you not want to
interrupt this little faggot everything
you know about haskell is something I
know about inner upper teens how about
them how about them apples huh
everything you know about Haskell or
Lisp I know about inner upper teens fuck
yourself nigger that's the detail
everything you know about Haskell I know
about inner upper teens understand
everybody in my generation we all wrote
serial port drivers rs-232 first thing
you do get on a piece of hardware you
write yourself some inner upper teens
for the receive and transmit interrupts
transmit interrupt receive interrupt
your interrupts routines get on a piece
of hardware right turner upper teens
little faggot I don't even want to enter
14 is
well as a matter of fact because they're
x86 if you really want to see look max I
NS QE and cert Q dancer specified this
ensures this is an assembly language
instruction on the backs and as a matter
of fact it is a lock it's a read modify
and right on the VAX this is an atomic
read-modify-write and on the x86 they
don't have this on the x86 they do not
have an atomic read-modify-write you can
turn off interrupts and then turn them
back on now there's a there's an
instruction that they don't teach the
faggots and what that instruction is is
a bit bit bit test and set have you ever
heard a bit test and set no you haven't
because you're a faggot bit test and set
is they is an atomic instruction if you
want to do a lock to let's say you have
a multitasking let's say you want to
lock this Q let's go ahead and do that
let's say you have two tasks that are
going to do this let's do we're gonna do
words prompt and what that's going to be
is this we're going to do words display
what that's going to be is this and
we're going to do words delete and
that's gonna be this
might as well I don't usually do
faggotry but
don't usually do fake oh it's nothing
okay now we're getting it closer to a
real program so words okay so now we
have it like this
now let's say we want to do this
multi-core you know let's do a multi
tasking okay so what do we have to do we
have to uh w lock is going to be a lock
and knit W lock equals zero okay so in
order to do this what we do is we say
wow let's go ahead and do that if you're
doing multi core locked bit test and set
address W block comma bit number zero
yield so let's
who
what are we doing now the the head okay
this this is a data structure and we
probably don't want we want to lock it
when word using it if you're doing
multitasking if you're doing multi core
multitasking okay so what did we just do
here we just did a locked you know I put
a lock on it so now we can actually call
it from multitasking and it will be safe

this is kind of this burns the CPU let's
do an analysis okay if you have five
tasks and two of them are using this
what's gonna happen well it's gonna one
of them's gonna yield the CPU if it's
busy and it's gonna go ahead and do the
other tasks so the question is is this
is this really going to waste
what's the performers gonna be like it's
tricky as a matter of fact this takes
two 15 nanoseconds my my scheduler is so
fast and so lightweight that I can do
four million swaps a second per per CPU
per core so this is an extraordinarily
lightweight my scheduler is so
lightweight because it doesn't have to
change maps all it has to do is like
save sixteen registers it is so
lightweight it actually allows a whole
new style of programming it allows a
whole new style of programming
and this is how you do it my goal is to
keep it as as I want you with your feet
on the bottom of the pond and once you
want your feet on the bottom of the pond
now you want you might ask how close are
we to the bottom of the pond guess what
guess what do you know how close we are
to the bottom of the pond if you go in
here to the Intel manual and you go to
do you want to know how close we are to
the having your feet on the bottom let
me just show you bit tested set this is
an atomic construction and you can put a
block prefix on it and there's a matter
of fact this is actually a this is a
single instruction locked bit test and
reset locked bit test and set so your
feet are actually resting on the bottom
of the pond okay your feet are on the
bottom of the pond you're not in the
ocean with god-knows-what underneath you
this is an assembly instruction your
feet are on the bottom of the pond okay
it's a it's a it's a atomic instruction
and so that's how you do it if you want
to do multi core this is the way you do
it you can do a multi core hello puppy
as a matter of fact listen nigger listen
nigger our goal is to be a Commodore 64
okay you see the the the new Knicks
nigger will move heaven and earth so
that you can play two video games at
once okay what good does it do to play
video games at once it doesn't do any
fucking good what we want to do is let
you have a task that plays music in the
background of your video game
our goal is so you can have a task that
plays music in the background of your
video game
our goal is so that you can have an
animation that uh our goal is so it's a
hundred percent tested it is fit for
purpose do you want to know what the
purpose that we fuck you little bigger
stuck the little niggers fucking getting
all fucking Munich see fuck so but it's
a this is better than Unix
when it comes to its purpose look see
this you see this you don't even have
graphics in your source code you little
fucking nigger this is one fucking file
two nine eight look at this this this
video game is 8,000 bytes with graphics
in the fucking source code it's not
separate files the fucking 3d graphics
in the fucking source code and it's how
many lines its 704 lines your fucking
retard nigger look look at your retard
nigger if I want to do a circle I can
put a fucking circle on the screen in
one goddamn line of code okay you know
Amazon Amazon does one click that's
because they're white people and they're
not niggers Amazon doesn't Amazon does
one-click shopping because they're
fucking white and they got it down to
one fucking click you see this nigger
one fucking click you got a fucking
nigger who made your fucking shit okay
one fucking click I got graphics on the
fucking
scream you see that this is bare-metal
you want to know what's below this
nothing this watch this let's do trace
you want to see what this involves this
is this is what's underneath this call
okay trick convert straight to assembly
pushes some instructions does it call
you see that nigger so called Amazon is
fucking white and your shit is nigger
you got a nigger okay this is fucking
white one click I got fuckin and
graphics on the screen what the fuck you
got fucking need a little monkey nigger
let's go see some ex windows with your
fucking shit let's go see ex windows you
got this new girl Isha's shit god let's
go see how do we put it how do we draw a
line i'll draw line in x windows look at
this fucking nigger shit want to see
some nigger shit look at this fucking
shit see how to draw a line in x windows
it's fucking nigger licious as hell ok
nigger fuck fuck you little nigger now
what are we trying to do are we trying
to run a server no we're trying to run a
fucking town or 64 ok what's our goal
but I'm gonna fucking boot that little
fucking nigger fuck that little nigger
where's that word that fucking nigger go
you're the fucking nigger is the Amazon
have 10 click no it's cuz your fuckin
nigger is Amazon have 10 click where did
you fucking go where that little nigger
go
you heard you're gone
this knee-jerk wants to play two video
games at once
that's a fucking UNIX nigger wants to
play two video games at once fuck you
little nigger little nigger wants to
play two video games at once little
nigger has 10 click Amazon he says I can
do a lot better Amazon Amazon
I got a to click solution that does a
whole lot more amazon says go fuck
yourself little fucking Munich's nigger
like I got ok we can get a lot more
statistics if we use to click its fuck
you little retard nigger so check this
out what's our goal our goal is to allow
a kid to write a game what do we want 10
do we want 100 server tasks no we want a
video game that has an animation task
with a with the loop the animation task
needs a fixed loop the screen update has
to run at 30 times a second with a
callback so the screen the screen test
we're doing multi-core the screen the
screen task has to run 30 times a second
okay so for example if if we need to
wait for the multi course this is an
example where I set in motion 16 multi
course drawing the screen and then what
do I do I wait until they're all done at
this point I wait and how do I wait I
wait with a yield okay
now you might say that burden CPU it
does not burn CPU we have one we have
one video game we don't fucking care
it's fucking awesome it doesn't burn
we do the multi-core tasks when the
multi-core tasks are finishing there
there's their part of the screen what do
they do they do a locked here's what you
do
the master core zero task sets em let's
say you have eight cores then you take
eight shift it over is 256 minus one so
you get 255 loaded into the flags and
then as each core you have core 0 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 when they finish they clear
their flag and then when all the flags
are done you are ready to move on we are
waiting until all the flags are done see
how that works
we're using the lock we reason we're
using one lock bit for for each core and
we're testing them all at once and then
the UNIX nerd he doesn't know why some
people just do or die and they don't
know why some people can't analyze can
can the UNIX Nigar analyze this no the
UNIX nigger is too stupid the UNIX
nigger says oh that's polling the UNIX
nigger is too stupid to analyze ok the
UNIX nigger is too stupid to analyze we
have 5 tasks it's going in a circle
loading in each task around the queue
one of them it's gonna skip if it's not
ready it takes takes 25 Nana it takes
two 50 nanoseconds is that gonna be a
problem no it's not gonna be a fucking
problem you little fucking retard nigger
why is it yours takes 10,000 nano sector
yours takes a hundred thousand
nanoseconds I might only take 250
nanoseconds do I go and say you're a
nigger I say no you're doing a server
with a bunch of people I don't I'm
smart enough to say no mine's a counter
sixty-four years is a server Linux is a
semi this is a motorcycle are they the
same no they're not the fucking same
yours can have a hundred people on it
it's a fucking semi bus okay fuck it
this is a motorcycle okay fuck you you
don't got the concept of a difference
you think everything is a fucking semi
everything is not a fucking semi fucking
nigger fuck you man do I do I want to
run a bank on this no I don't want to
run a bank on this when there was a
Commodore they had banks did they right
did they run the bank on a Commodore no
of course not
they had fucking vaccin shit didn't they
well they had fucking faxes to run the
bank and they had a Commodore to fucking
play video games okay fucking nigger
seems to think the fucking nigger wants
everybody to ride to work in a fucking
semi-truck why would we want to ride to
work in a fucking semi-truck you fucking
nigger why would we want to ride to work
in a fucking semi
so we got we got graphics and source
code I have an editor as a matter of
fact if you load if you download the to
mag version you can still do all this
shit I get a compiler you should look at
the little demo which anyway so we have
a we can edit the mesh this is the
editor it's graphics and source code
edit mesh so you can change the angles
it's basically triangles and it's not
very much fun okay you might give up and
do a lot of it by hand vertices and
triangles vertices and triangles anyway
not stored as binary in the file
so if we see don't
if we say dump room we say don't dump
broom got holy see compressed so look at
this this is the file it's got the text
area first it's it's not a lot of people
assume it's a it's an archive it's not
an archive it's the file format is is is
it's not a ski it's the definition is
it's it's more like a PDF and it's a
little bit like a PDF
do you have text you have eight this is
this is eight bit in other words it's
not it's not a violation it is it is it
is definitely eight bit okay
you are fucking allowed eight bit well
of course we don't have seven bit sign
then fuck that it's eight bit so you can
use it you can use the Greek characters
and then there's a zero after the ASCII
portion and then there's binary data for
the for the graphics now the interesting
thing is there's lzw compression
built-in if you have a dot Z and so all
of this gets compressed okay it
automatically gets compressed so if the
file name ends in dot Z then when it's
fetched and when it's stored it
compresses a nun compresses so in the
file in the text area you have dollar
sign commands it's kind of you know how
HTML has angles like that
well temple OS has dollar sign for a
start dollar sign for an end this is a
sprite there's a two character command
code
this is sprite this is tag four and this
is the this is for a binary binary value
number four there are four binary values
tacked onto the
and no that's not correct and then later
on in the code when you want to use
those images you can you can pass a
pointer to the binary value this is
insert binary or it's a it's a pointer
to a binary they call them binaries
because it's it's binary data there are
binary objects on the end in theory you
could have other things besides sprites
but the only thing there is is sprites
there there's one exception I went I
went ahead I did an exception do you see
this map file as a matter of fact I used
the same text format and I didn't I do
that
yeah these have binary on them so
there's a the map file has has binary
numbers for if you want to on the symbol
print you see these it has the line
number offsets and the way that works is
there's a map file and if we go down to
print if we find print
let's see if we can find print in here
there's print so this is binary number
544 and if we did a dump of the map file
then the 544 would have a list of all
the the line number offsets and that's
how when it boots you know how so we're
going to go to the root directory when
it boots it it executes start OS and
this is the script it's it's Holy See
and in here it it loads the headers for
the for the kernel and compiler and then
it and then it does the atom directory
atom is the father of all tasks atom is
the father of all tasks he's the first
task created like Adam and Eve Adam is
the father of all tasks is the first
test created all children inherit their
parent symbols so if a symbol is not
found in a symbol table then it searches
the parent right now we have we have one
symbol let's say we this is kind of like
MATLAB I'm gonna declare an integer and
then I'm gonna say who if you don't say
- R it includes a parent so we have a
global variable in the symbol table we
can do a we can do a function you don't
normally do functions but you can do
normally you do it in a file but it
works
this is printf okay so we just did a
function now if we say count to 10 you
see how that works
so we're doing a trace and it compiled
count it's not an interpreter it's not a
fucking interpreter I wrote a compiler
it would be extra work to make an
interpreter I did not do an interpreter
I wrote a fucking compiler and then
after it compiled the function it did a
function call with the argument 10 and
here here is where it does here it
pushes 10 and then it does a call and
then it returns and so right now if we
say who - our count is a function and
it's in our this is kind of like
environment variables what this is is
it's just like a common or where you can
program in basic you neither execute a
command immediately like 1 + - 1 + 2 is
3
you can either execute a command
immediately or you can make a function
this is kind of like the way the basic
program would work you put it in memory
now here's the this is the interesting
thing let's say I equals 1 2 3 so what
did it do there's a there's a variable
it stored 1 2 3 into a variable now what
if we say address of AI
but the dress of AI is 0 xxx
or whatever over here now if we come
over here we can also say i-64 let's say
star pointer equals and I'm gonna give
it that address now on other operating
systems with different memory maps you
can't you can't access other look at
that 1 2 3 we got it okay there's only
one and addresses and address some
people think this is stack Noah's not
stack go fuck yourself it's not stack so
uh now like I said tasks and they're at
symbols of parents and everybody has
Adam as a parent and so if we say who
these are all the symbols in Adams table
and that means we can use them we never
need to do a pound include for headers
you never need to do pound include
because all the symbols in the operating
system are in Adams table you never have
to do a pound include isn't that cool
you never have to do a pound include now
if I say Adam as a matter of fact Adam
has a window believe it or not Adam has
a window you're not allowed you're not
allowed to Adam is kind of like a
special server his memory is like kernel
memory he never dies everybody else can
die but Adam never dies and so if you
want to make a DLL let's say we want to
make a DLL let's make it okay first of
all let's say uh Adam hey Adam why don't
you make a variable called J and then we
say J was one four one five six and then
we come over here do you know what's
gonna happen all tasks inherit symbols
of parents if we say J holy shit that's
available and it's 156 so we inherit all
his we told Adam to do some code
so now now all that system has
system-wide so if we want to make a uh
let's say we want to this is this let's
go to the startup script this is like
autoexec would start OS okay we're gonna
we're gonna be pretty you're not really
allowed to modify this but it this will
this will invoke your home your home
files can have at the end of the startup
it invokes your home file so let's go to
our home file in our home file it's
gonna include some of our own home
directory now let's say we want a u 0
DLL beeper or something we're gonna make
we're gonna make a function we want this
to be a DLL ok and what this will do is
beep its gonna beep and print fuck so
you wanna know some people say how some
people ask how do you make a DLL well
BAM now when we boot everybody has
access to DLL beeper fuck he has access
he has access it's in the it's in Adams
table
ok everybody has it it's that it's that
easy to make a DLL what do you want a
global variable that system-wide that
everybody can do well that's not a
problem I 64 my global
okay now let's reboot okay now what if
we crash this let's just first of all
let's say DLL beeper
it printed the global we want to say my
1 1 okay we didn't do plus plus anyway
you get the idea what if we what if we
put an error in here with what we spear
something up
this is terrifying okay so if we boot
holy fuck our system is not booting well
what you really want to do is reboot and
boot the other partitioned I'll show you
in a second I'll let you can reboot and
your the bootloader will boot either C
or D and so what you do is you keep your
D as a rescue backup now we can go ahead
and we can go to drive C we can go to
the root no we want to go to the home
directory and then we want to go modify
make home and we can fix it and then it
would boot but let's just do another
thing which is uh I'm gonna boot okay so
it crashes sometimes you can do fix
there's an emergency editor and no it
didn't work it's not editing the right
file usually it I'm surprised it didn't
work anyway so we're in the home
directory let's say
I'm gonna be no fun when you have okay
now I'm gonna emergency editor we just
got rid of that I'm gonna get rid of
this shit in here to escape and then
reboot now we Bootsy seed now boots okay
so you can try the fix I'm gonna go
ahead and do a merge check this is what
I do to see if I changed anything I do a
snapshot C to D it's only like 25 Meg's
so it's not really a problem so this is
everything I've changed in the last
eight hours
I think I changed this spacing out what
I want to do is I want to go to I want
to go to the I'm gonna go to drive D I'm
gonna go to drive D I'm gonna go to the
home directory and just to be safe I
want to copy the original back to see I
just want to keep the same whites
I want the same white space that I
always had I don't want to modify the
white space on accident anyway
luckily Pama sore okay so uh I'll get
you going
as a matter of fact here's what I think
of object oriented okay do you want to
know what I think of object oriented
well I made a list of my these are my
symbols do you notice something about
this do you notice how I name these
things that look familiar
what happens if I want to rename my
vertex what happens if I want to rename
my vertex delete mesh vertex delete okay
let's say I want to rename that I want
to say rename mesh vertex delete I want
to rename it to mesh vertex

delete let's just do that now how would
I do this if it were object-oriented how
would I do that
I'm gonna ask you a question how would I
do this if it were object-oriented tell
me how I would do that can you answer me
please tell me can you tell me how I do
that because I do this all the time I a
rename shit all the time you know tell
me how I do that with object-oriented
any anybody waiting oh how do i rename a
bluebird do that maybe the editor will
do it but uh what the fuck's going on
know the problem here's the problem you
want to know what the problem is
here's the problem if if we're doing
object oriented this is not vertex mesh
delete all that is just de oh okay when
it's object oriented all you have is de
el you don't have the full thing
so
I I like I like the concepts of I
embrace object-oriented but do you want
the you can see that I embrace
object-oriented you know do you know why
because when I do my document routines
do you know do you see how I name them
you don't I named them doc dr. Lee doc
doc form doc form backward doc form
forward so I I have created object
oriented in in see without C++ doc tree
so I made it object-oriented didn't I
I made it object oriented so Temple OS
is object oriented it's just not done
Temple OS is object oriented it's just
not done using C++

you can address you can go to the
symbols
what does object-oriented mean what it
means is
let's look at the hash table hash table
ad
let's look at another one this is a good
job
well
lexical analyzers Lex
you pass it a control structure for the
Lex
Lex Lex file pop okay you pass it a
control structure and it does something
so as a matter of fact C++ saves you the
trouble of passing the object first you
have to pass the object first but other
than that it's you can do C plus you can
do object-oriented if you pass the the
parameter you just have to name it
that's all and then you can do
object-oriented all you have to do is
pass the variable
instead this you know I'm just talking
about this yeah it doesn't do this
automatically you have to you have to
pass it that this you remember how I
said in temple OS you're in a pond
here's the deal in temple OS you are in
a pond and your feet are on the bottom
in other systems your fucking in the
ocean and nobody has any idea what's
underneath them
okay in other operating system and other
systems they the CIA wants you impotent
in clueless they want dumb nigger cattle
so what do they do they confuse the hell
out of you like free free and Malak are
too easy so they have to clusterfuck it
now you've got some kind of critter what
is this object see I don't even I don't
even want to know what object see is
what's what's hard about free and Malick
you know it's fucking simple okay so now
they clusterfuck it
so in Temple OS this is not hit and the
object-oriented this is not hidden its
that's the only difference in tempo s
you have your feet you have your feet on
the bottom of the pond you're not in the
middle of the ocean God knows how that
this happens
there's there's there's no limit this
it's the only reason I put a limit is so
that it doesn't get big okay oh there's
no technical there's no technical limit
here's the deal okay let's say somebody
tell I mean I'm asking the class how do
you make a project scale upward okay can
you tell me what you do you do you how
do you make us project scale-up word do
namespaces right if you look long
descriptive variables and function yeah
I'm asking how do you do you do mate
with dependencies so that you only do a
little bit at a time you try what what
else do you do you do uh it's instead of
simple algorithms use the more
complicated one
okay so so here's the deal if if I were
gonna scale up and make it forty million
make a list make a list of everything I
would do to scale up to forty million
lines of code guess what
let's pretend you're starting a new
operating system and you want to scale
down from forty million to one hundred
thousand okay now make a list of
everything you do to scale down from
forty million to one hundred thousand
okay how do you scale down what are all
the things you do what are all the
things you do you do the opposite
everything you do to scale up you do the
opposite do opposite to scale down to
one hundred thousand okay you do the
opposite what did I just hear you say
that you little nigger did I did I did I
actually just hear you say that there's
no reason to scale down wait wait wait
where we make a list of everything to
scale from one hundred thousand to forty
million what was the list
tell me what's what's the list what's
the list we do you want lots of
namespaces we want long labels no
Global's no Global's careful to make
okay did you see we made a list make
lists to scale for 100 to 40 million
okay now how do we scale from 40 million
to 100,000 make all the labels really
short use global variables global
variables use one namespace you see how
that works you see how that works if you
scale up you do this if you if you're
making a semi truck a semi truck is 40
million lines of code a motorcycle is a
hundred thousand lines of code do you
see how that works
do you see how that works a semi truck
is 40 million lines of code a motorcycle
is a hundred thousand the the little the
little Microsoft nigger says no no no
you got to use the big 20 gearbox on you
got to used to 20 gearbox on a
motorcycle go what the fuck do I wanted
20 gearbox from a semi on a fucking
motorcycle I don't want to fucking I
want a two-stroke engine okay I want a
two-stroke engine and I don't want to
fucking 16 you see how that works you
see how that works make a list for
everything you change the scale from 40
from one hundred thousand to forty
million okay make a list of everything
you change to scale from 100 thousand to
forty million now here's a trick
question trick how do how do you scale
from 40 million to 100,000 it's the same
fucking list it's it's the same list but
you do it backwards that's the answer
your little dumb fuck nigger it's the
same fucking list but you do it backward
okay everything you do to scale from one
hundred thousand to forty million you do
the same fucking list but to do it
backward that's the fucking answer no no
today you have a today you'd have a
semi-truck we want to make a motorcycle
how do we make a motor so we can still
the nigger says here's what the nigger
says the nigger says the nigger says we
made a semi it is no longer possible to
ever make a motorcycle the nigger says
it is no longer possible to ever make a
motorcycle the nigger says it is no
longer possible to ever make a
motorcycle know what you do you do
everything everything you do to scale up
you do the opposite to scale down you
see how that works everything you do to
scale up you do the opposite to scale
down
here's what guess what nigger do you
want to know why let me tell you why
here's what you do do you want to know
why I'm gonna go in modify my kernel and
Mike let me tell you okay so here's the
difference the Commodore 64 was for
white people the Commodore 64 was for
white people see 64th users guide the
Commodore 64 was only for white people
the Commodore 64 was only for white
people this is in the box you got a book
in the book it tells you how to program
in basic not a single nigger ever got a
Commodore 64 and programmed in basic ok
this was not for niggers ok you see how
that works it was not for niggers one of
the things I did with my Commodore in
with my Commodore I didn't always play
games I had a book that told me what
every location in the kernel did ok what
every location in the ROM did so what
can a kid do with ok so how long does it
take to compile the kernel in in Windows
takes pretty long how long does it take
to compile the kernel in Linux you want
to see it I can compile my kernel
I just compiled my kernel and my
compiler I compiled every bit of code on
the system in one fucking second
is that possible is it possible to
compile everything on the system in one
second
is it possible to compile everything on
the system in one second how is that
possible that's in fucking possible it's
not fucking possible how long does it
take to compile all code in Linux
how long does it take how many lines of
code is it what is it 20 million in two
hours 20 million in two hours
takes about 20 million in two hours
right compile everything in Linux is 20
million in two hours so 20000 we want
2/3 600 times - ok well they have to
recompile the headers over and over but
guess what I can compile all my code I
don't even you know what everybody knows
that when it when it gets bigger it
doesn't just get bad it gets worse
everybody knows when you scale up it's
not linear it's worse ok everybody knows
when you scale up it's not linear it's
worse ok when you scale down it doesn't
just get better it gets fucking awesome
ok when you scale down it doesn't just
get better it gets
awesome no you want to know what the
difference is let me tell you what the
difference is here's my I want you to be
in a pond with your feet on the bottom
of the pond ok I don't want you to be in
the ocean with no fucking clue and
here's the difference I put all the
system help on f1 when you press f1 here
is an index of every single function in
the operating system these are all the
disk functions right here these are all
the hash table functions right here ok
you want to know what a Commodore had
you want to know why let me just show
you what a cobbler had let me show you
what a Commodore had c64 users guide
check this out on a Commodore you could
go to the back of the book
in the back of the book
they would tell you they had a list of
all the commands continue list load new
run save verify close clear look at this
there's a list of all the commands guess
what guess what just we guess what guess
what we reach the end that's it
guess what we reached we fucking reached
the end holy fuck
do you know what this is like this is
like being in a pond with their feet on
the bottom instead of being way the fuck
out in the middle of the ocean with no
fucking clue you see how that works
that's the difference okay
you're in a pond your feet are on the
bottom
you're not in the middle of the ocean
okay now you know what it is first I'm
gonna go a miracle okay
this is God's third temple I am the most
famous human past present or future
because I made the third temple and I
proved God in a made contact with an
alien I had the most famous human past
present or future because I prove God I
made the third temple and I made contact
with an alien
we're gonna get
you're in a pond your feet are on the
bottom instead of being in the middle of
the fucking ocean with no clue ting with
no land in sight and no clue what's
underneath you in Linux you have no
fucking clue what's underneath you
so we're getting the we're gonna we're
gonna go to line number 300 8 1 300 8 1
here's what God says
the two doors were also of olive trees
he carved upon them carvings of cherubim
and palm trees and open flowers and
overlaid them with gold and spread gold
on the cherubs and upon the palm trees
so awesome ad for the door of the temple
post of olive tree a fourth part of the
wall and the two doors were a fir trees
and the two leaves of the one door were
folding and the two leaves the other
door were folding and he carved there on
jeroboams and palm trees and open
flowers covered them with gold fitted
upon the carved work and he built the
inner court with three rows of huge
stone huge stone and a row of cedar
beams and the fourth year was the
foundation of the house the Lord laid in
a month zip and it was the eleventh year
in the month the bull which is the
eleventh month which was the house
finished throughout all lovely
my first job was as a professional
operating system developer at
Ticketmaster and so I've been a
professional operating system developer
so what did I do
when I was unemployed with in 2004 I got
my old operating system from real mote I
started in real mode dos I wrote an
assembly program to teach to protected
mode and in 2004 I got that program and
I started working on it and I worked on
it year after year and then God started
saying it was his temple god started
saying it was his temple everybody had
their own why because it was a lot more
efficient it we Tim take him back
Ticketmaster used many computers to on
June 3rd employees of the iconic alt
rock man Pixies gathered outside London
for an experiment armed with five
iPhones and customized barcode scanning
software they spent two hours selling
admissions for 3,000 fans who have
learned in surplus context concert
through word-of-mouth the Pixies created
a system called topspin media a company
that helped artists an Eminem metric Ok
Go
market their music and wares directly to
fans there was no surcharge no booking
fee and Richard Jones a Pixies manager
said 30 pounds of 30 pounds almost
almost anyone who goes to concerts
understands why it is so significant no
service charts zero the Pixies of Top
Spin had sidestepped the seemingly
inevitable fees tacked on any ticket
they had in other words I stepped
Ticketmaster to the juggernaut that
sells more than art and 30 million
tickets a year for everybody from Lady
Gaga shows to monster truck rallies
started as an experiment
Ticketmaster has since deployed a near
lock on the multibillion-dollar
ticketing industry and the company is
only getting bigger last winter it
merged with Live Nation the largest
concert promoter in the country which
means that in effect it can master now
also controls access to acts like you to
jay-z and owns many of the amphitheaters
in the US including Irvine Meadows
Verizon Verizon amphitheater in
California and the night continent at
Jones Beach theater in Langton in New
York among fans and artists of course
dick masters widely despised it attracts
hi sir it extracts high service fees
commonly known as those goddamn
Ticketmaster services but has offered
very little innovation in ticketing over
the past 30 years The Pixies for example
added thousands of names complete with
contact info to their marketing database
things to Troy X gig something they
can't gentlemen get when they sell
tickets they're diggin master and now in
the wake of Lida nation merger many of
the counselor and industry are worried
thinking master might be more interested
in promoting its own artists and venues
than selling tickets for rival acts this
is unleashed a new scramble for
alternatives in offices around the u.s.
startup staff
veteran ticketing executives are backed
with millions of dollars in venture
capital to find ways to sell seats to
fans among them is bear Takes which runs
flat flash seats a paperless system for
music sports a man steak and fly a
company that recently received 3 million
in venture capital in addition to ticket
sales help clients market events on
Twitter and Facebook and in ticketing
which handles Burning Man and hundreds
of other events many in the music
business hope that with lower fees and
more integrity someone become someone
these companies might be able to pry
away business from the behemoth it would
be great if a more nimble more
technology savvy company could come
along and figure out how to make money
with much lower service fee system
Windish agent for such cutting edge
access hot chips xxxx yyyy sayers but
Ticketmaster didn't come to roll in the
industry by suffering interlopers over
the past 30 years the company has killed
or eaten nearly every competitor
ticketron ticket web ticket now pass the
line and music today in a potent
combination of top artists venues and
long-term tickling meals makes
Ticketmaster one Goliath well-positioned
to crush a whole army of David's Peter
GAD what this was I went to lunch with
him every day from about 1992 night 1996
was an IT staff right Arizona State
University when he teamed up with Albert
left lift
Leffler Lafleur what the fuck then
working at ASU Performing Arts Center to
create Ticketmaster in 1976 the duel
originally set out to design a ticket
selling program that would outperform
small regional company called select the
seat would serve the University theaters
better the University Theatre they
succeeded so much so that the pair soon
took aim at left your competitor
ticketron then the dominant ticket
seller in the concert business the SU
team members were using modest digital
equipment company that's backs
well ticketron had hyper expensive
controlled data mainframes so gad WA and
Leffler simply out programmed ticketron
creating software that would allow their
limited computers to behave like more
expensive systems letting 500 operators
log into the system at the same time
took more than smart code however to
turn Ticketmaster into one of the
world's most powerful entertainment
companies took the arrival of 1982 of
the new leader Fred Rosen fast-talking
lawyer and
amateur comedian who had profound
realization ticketing isn't about bands
or fans about the venues shortly after
he was hired Rosen systematically
contact the biggest concert halls arenas
in the countries have made them the same
spectacular offer where ticket Ron
Trotter charged venues for service
adding a minimal fee to customers one
dollar per ticket
Rosen offered to actually pay the venues
he would increase service fees and split
the money with whoever housed the
concert and her sporting event everybody
signed up with ticket rent everybody
signed up ticket ron was quickly
decimated in 1991 it surrendered I was
there at the surrender of ticket Ron I
went to the Hackensack New Jersey office
I went into the office of ticket Ron at
the surrender and I got to see the
doomed employees and Hackensack New
Jersey and I had to convert there they
had campgrounds and I had to take their
inventory of seats and put them into our
system so I had to convert from their
ticket Ron and campground inventory into
our system
anyway when ticket Ron came to an end
GAD was said I felt more like we had
stumbled on a beached whale that had
already died then defeated a fierce
enemy in battle the system continued for
three decades to underlying technology
barely changed however even when
expanded in 1990s to accommodate the
internet a few computer systems can
handle the strain of 500 Madonna fans
all attempting to buy tickets seconds
after the seat hits the market not to
mention withstand repeated attacks by
BOTS trying to scoop up tickets for
resale but despite being the product of
what even taking master executives
acknowledged is 30 years of patchwork
worked around the company system is
almost supernaturally reliable then in 9
2007 Live Nation president and CEO
Michael Rapinoe a former Canadian beer
executive married to one time
Star Trek Enterprise Vulcan Jolene
Ballack decided that his promotion
company owns so many venues that it
should sell tickets itself Rapinoe
enlisted to help with an experienced
German ticket specialist called
CTS event him to build a new system but
the plan crumbled almost immediately
when a fish reunion tour went on sale in
2009 the new Live Nation ticketing
couldn't
manage ten million fish heads
simultaneously buying for 250,000
tickets the resulting press was horrible
even worse though Live Nation discovered
that concert fans were trained to buy
tickets at Ticketmaster and nowhere else
concert attendance dropped almost as
soon as Ticketmaster sites stopped
serving
Live Nation in 2008 two Ticketmaster had
made veteran industry shark Irving Azoff
a man so cutthroat and so short he is
known as the poisoned dwarf its CEO
managers of the Eagle since the mid 70s
as office aimlessly aggressive he once
sent a gift wrap boa constrictor to a
manager his wife he considered
snake-like with a note that read now you
have to sing Live Nation's trouble as
off recognize an opportunity after
several conversations the two companies
agreed to merge in January the US
Department of Justice approved formation
of Live Nation entertainment DOJ
approved did require a few concessions
however perhaps the most significant of
these was ticking masters obligation to
license that sticking selling software
for two years to live nation's biggest
rival in the promotion game AEG Live the
idea was that this would give a eg
lifetime to develop its own taking him
suffer
AEG said it was working on this but so
far it has little to show making it
unclear how much the DOJ considers the
actual spur competition for all its
clout Ticketmaster has two major
problems that obviously it gouges ticket
buyers but less talked about is the lack
of flexibility with an old codebase a
huge customer roster and a
long-established way of doing things
tea masters notoriously sold to
intimated its new CEO Nathan Hubbard
points out that the company is starting
to add features like interactive steep
Maps but he even he acknowledges that it
can't turn on a dime like a startup
virtually all the new ticketing startups
even to lower service fees to fans but
because of this isn't necessarily
important to venues in fact it may run
counter to their interest the new guys
must focus on taking master second
weakness in ability to innovate and this
is just what they're doing to delight
people in the industry like Mike Talman
32 year old vice president of sales that
service at Cleveland Cavaliers in
October 2009 the Cleveland Cleveland
Cavaliers did take master in favor of
Varitek's flash seat the service is
unique in that it allows fans to buy
tickets online and transfer
anybody else by email even reselling
that it okay so I left in 1996 its
number anyway
hey hey hey nigger look at this hey do

tell God a joke and then he will talk to
you if you don't tell God a joke he's
not going to talk to you it's a space

look I can random do you get the idea
random number okay you randomly open the
fucking book God talks random fucking
number okay
random fucking number do you understand
any fucking random number you go here
hot bits Geiger counter
these are Geiger counter random numbers
Geiger counter random numbers we can go
here there's a hundred thousand lines in
the Bible let's do a random number nine
two six four one nine two six four one
any fucking random number it's a space

post nine two six four one they which
preach the gospel should live of the
gospel but I have used none of these
things neither have I written these
things that it should be done to me for
it were better for me to die than for
any man make my glory void for though I
preached the gospel I had nothing to
Gloria for necessity is laid upon me
yeah what was me for I preach not the
gospel for if I do this thing willingly
I have a reward but if against my will a
dispensation of gospel is committed unto
me what is my reward verily that when I
preach the gospel
I make me make the gospel of Christ
without charge that I abuse not my power
in the gospel for though I'd be free
from all men yet have I made myself
servant unto all that I might gain the
more
random fucking number let's just let's
go it okay we're gonna go into the Bible
we're gonna go into the King James Bible
1 Kings 6 this is the King James Bible
in the King James Bible Solomon made the
temple he built 20 cubits on the side
house both the floor in the walls with
boarded cedar he even built them for
within even for the Oracle what do you
suppose the Oracle is in the temple even
for the most holy place in the house
that was the temple before it was 40
cubits long in the cedar of the house
within the carved with nops and open
flowers the cedar was there was no stone
seen and the Oracle he prepared it in
the house to set the Ark of the Covenant
the Lord in the Oracle the four part of
the twenty what is an Oracle let's let's
just what is an Oracle Oh
RHD led an agency or media giving such
responses that's what a fucking Oracle
is the divine communication of
Revelation you see how that works
fucking random number okay fucking
random number there's a fucking random
number generator in the fucking temple
okay they did offerings and they
inquired of the Lord
if you
over and over they inquired of the Lord
they killed animals by the thousands why
did they fuckin kill animals do you ever
wonder about that do you ever wonder
about that did God talk to them or did
they talk to God children struggled
together so she went in to inquire of
the Lord the Lord said to her two
nations are in your womb okay mono I
said Lord what's your name inquire of
the God please ask that we may know so
they inquired further of the Lord okay
they inquired the Lord some men took
some Bridgman they did not ask the
counsel of Lord then they came about
David once the Lord things so I go up
where should I go up and some of Israel
Bethel inquired of God and said shall go
up to battle so David inquired of the
Lord shall I go back they're going to a
fucking Oracle okay they're going to

to entertain him okay
figure out how to how to entertain him
okay let's look at okay the nigger wants
to know how random works in the okay
random
- how does unique random work how does
UNIX random work dev random it allows
access to environmental noise collected
from device drivers and other sources
not all random number generators from
kernel-space was implemented first time
in linux the implementation is secure
hashes rather than ciphers a place for
the generator or originally designed
implemented the implementation in Turkey
keeps an estimate of the number of bits
of noise in an entropy pool from the HP
pool random numbers are created when
read-only returned random bytes with an
estimated number of bits and noise it's
like okay look nigger I'm gonna explain
this in nigger talk I'm gonna explain
this in nigger talk you turn on the
radio and you hear fuzzy static that's
fuckin random okay that's how it fucking
works okay you turn on the radio you
hear fuzzy static that's how it fucking
works and ast is okay the reason I use
the N is T here's the reason
Massachusetts this this is a State
Lottery website they published six
random numbers every 24 hours and it is
public for everybody to see this is a
public random website for NIS T they
publish 512 bits every 60 seconds it's
public for everybody to see if I tell
you check the numbers at 11:01 then you
can
I tell you to check I'll fuck you if I
tell you to check the numbers at 11:01
you can go to the State Lottery website
you can if I tell you to check the
numbers you can go to the State Lottery
website and everybody in the whole
world's can see them
the Fraiser says you're using your Wi-Fi
I said Frasier it's a fucking State
Lottery website how the fuck is my Wi-Fi
fucking changing the fucking State
Lottery website you nigger fucking near
oh you're using an artificial

website what kind of monkey nigger are
you okay so na st is in charge of them
of the of the gold a of the Platinum
kilogram they're in charge of the
Platinum meter
they are the all of scientific
researchers depend on measurements from
n is T and when they make a random
number it's a goddamn good random number
okay and is T is a really good random
number and they publish it every 60
seconds so that you get anybody in the
world can verify it it is fucking proof
you know how there's mathematical proofs
and there's no hole it's like no every
mathematical proof has a hole in it I
don't believe any mathematical proof
fuck you nigger you don't understand
math okay this is fucking math it's
fucking proven fucking suck my cock you
fucking nigger
it's fucking proven okay there's no hole
and yes it's a space alien trading post
okay it's a space alien trading post you
can talk out your mouth talk straight
out of your mouth you have look there
this is the way it works okay this is
the way it works here's the way it works
it's a space alien trading post it's a
space alien trading post Abel kept the
flocks and Caden worked to soil and of
course the tide and Cain brought some
fruit of the soil as an offering to the
Lord
Abel also brought an offering fat
portions from firstborn of his flock
so one offered steak one offered
cucumbers the Lord looked unable in his
offering would the Lord look with favor
on Abel and Abel offered steak but on
Cain who offered cucumbers he did not
look with favor so keen was very angry
in his face with downcast then the Lord
said to Cain why are you angry why is
your face down dressed if you do what is
right will you not be accepted but if
you do not want is right and sin is
crouching at the door desires too happy
to take you to rule over it so one guy
offered steak one guy offered cucumbers
God said fuck you and your cucumbers I
fucking taking their cucumbers go fuck
yourself now Cain said to Abel let us go
in the field while he's in the field kid
attacked his brother Abel and killed him
Lord said to Cain where's brother Abel I
don't know I I my brother's keeper
Florida what have you done listen your
brother's blood ok so what do you do you

deal in the early days they rolled dice
and the pagans thought that the dice
were alive with they thought the dice
were gods
okay that was idolatry in the early days
they thought the dice had God inside and
then came along the Christians and he
said no no no no no God is inside of us
when we rolled the dice and they said
God God is inside of us when we roll the
dice
I come along and I say no no no no God

ok so now we're going to we're gonna
take the first five decimal digits out
of the N is T and use them as a line
number I Babe Ruth
pointed at the fence in N is T is every
60 seconds so I have I have to point at
the fence and call out I have to call
which minute ahead of time and what I
have to call which minute ahead of time
otherwise it would I have to call which
minute ahead of time it's now 12 13 I
think Jack let's what did I cut my my
program automatically does it two
minutes ahead so like I called out of
213 oh fucking high that's embarrassing
anyway uh so we go to here 4 to 13 it
took a couple seconds to get it up and
running to 13 9 to 3 7 5
no no 9 2 4 3 7 9 2 4 3 7
that's the line number 9 2 4 3 7 so we
come in here 9 to throw four three seven

what does God say God says body for two
saith he shall be one flesh but he that
is joined unto the Lord is one spirit
flee fornication every sin in a man
knoweth with his body but that when to
commit a committeth fornication sinneth
against his own body what know ye not
that your body is the temple of the Holy
Ghost which is in you which you have a
God in me or not your own for a year but
with a price therefore glorify God in
your body and in your spirit which are
gods now concerning the things whereof
you wrote unto me it is good for a man
not to touch a woman nevertheless to
avoid fornication let every man have his
own wife and that every woman have her
own husband let the husband render unto
the wife due benevolence likewise also
the wife unto the husband temples of the
Holy Spirit

look why don't you go fucking talk to
God okay you trade with them and maybe
he'll talk okay you go talk to God okay
I worked for Ticketmaster 1992 1996 as a
programmer on their operating system
God said we are the Roman Empire and
Muslims are the barbarian niggers
God said we're the Roman Empire Muslims
are the barbarian niggers
what are you talking about did you can
go you can get the best random numbers n
is T n is T has the best kilogram
Platinum kilogram all the researchers
calibrate their kilogram to n is T they
have the best meter all the researchers
calibrate their meter to n is T and ast
has the best random numbers if a
scientist wants random numbers he uses n
is T they are the best it can get okay
there's random.org all of these work
okay give me some Nobel prizes I can
prove that God can control I can prove
God couldn't control Geiger counters
computer and room number internet
research this brings in random numbers
generated or process got your mother
tube this is a Geiger counter random
numbers we can use these we can use
these we can use we can use particle
anti particles particle all these
sources God controls all the random
numbers in the universe these are
controlled by these random numbers are
generated by random fluctuations phase
frequencies
vacuum is considered space empty of
matter and photons see a virtual
particles appearing and disappearing so
these are random vacuum fluctuations we
can do anti particles God controls all
random numbers okay
it's what doesn't the question is not
what does God control
it's what doesn't God control
nigger what part little look nigger
hey fucking nigger
do you want to see something nigger do
you know what an avatar is do you know
what an avatar is I can prove that God
moves my fingers I can prove with
science that God moves my fingers and
God moves your fingers okay I don't know
how we do that all I have to do
okay so I'm gonna run this okay what we
have here is a high-speed clock okay now
if you know anything about clocks they
have to be synchronized every 10 bits
you have to have a transition and if if
you don't have them synchronized it's
impossible so this is well beyond the
human brain okay we are generating
random numbers when I press the button
well beyond the human brain okay this
proves that I am God's avatar because it
is superhuman
gushie captive sardonically brood
wariness carpooled consistency toils so
as a matter of fact my body is
controlled by God so if I write
something God can write it so that's how
the Bible was written by God God used an
avatar he made their brain think words
they wrote them down I can prove it with
this fucking program because it fucking
controls my fingers when it fucking god
fucking controls my fingers down to the
fucking nanosecond the Bible was fucking
written by God okay fuck you
the Bible was fucking written by God
okay now this is kind of dorky they
should be saying English words but just
to show you these people and says that
religions which incorporates speaking in
tongues are some of today's
fastest-growing they've managed to reach
people that the normal Baptist
Episcopalians and Methodists simply
haven't gotten to and frankly I think
there's one very simple reason there are
a lot of people in the world who can't
sit still for enough for a whole hour he
says people want to experience religion
to feel it identify him strongly with
the group says psychologist Steven J Lin
is what makes speaking in tongues
appealing to so met pastor of a huge
congregation in Florida who says his
gift is also his armor seem that a big
key okay those goofballs
those goofballs had tried to
yeah I speak English words and it makes
it works a lot better try and speak
random English words you can find
yourself saying intelligence higher than
your own intelligence if when you say
random words sometimes it's higher
intelligence than your own intelligence
but the point is we don't need to we
don't we don't need to fuck around you
know we don't need to fuck around we got
fucking a hard proof here
this is the UNIX random oxide depth

this is Linux random replenishing

okay here's what you use okay it's a
space alien trading post and you all you
need to use is this Linux command ok
there you go now you can you don't need
to speak in tongues you don't need to
speak in tongues you can just use this
ok space alien trading post he said good
Lee gook didn't he you got a you got a
trade with them you know what I mean
tell him a story telling me sauce and
praise God for sunshine and flowers and
snowflakes and popcorn and any use any
file use any file any file of words
doesn't matter any file use any any word
file any word file you like how do you

okay if you don't like that random
number I got ten different random
numbers sources which one which one
would make you happy which go tell me
you tell me which random number go on
the Internet
do you want random.org I can use that if
that makes you happy you can use it I
can use it you can use it if you're
doing offering there's hot bits this is
this is this is Geiger counter random
numbers that works that works just fine
which one do you want me to use take
your pick
are they all broken are all the random
numbers broken excuse me I'm sorry are
all the random numbers broken as I was
trying to say I think that's what you're
trying to say you're trying to say all
the random numbers are broken that's
what you're trying to say you're like

surely die Jonathan and people said to
Saul with rut the street salvation okay`,

`so I could publish this on my website or
that's kind of a what's the word
unnatural the flow like publishing
waiting publishing waiting it's kind of
fucked up so instead I'm just gonna go
I'm just gonna go like just talk to God
what the hell let's use the temple it's
a sacred space this is a prayer the
prayer shrine you ever seen a prayer
shrine the shrine is kind of a place to
pray I guess how about that prayer yeah
let's see you ever seen a prayers right
which don't
that's something like uh whatever maybe
got a chaired some place to pray around
some shit like that
so what the hell that's a prayer shrink
God said to remove my veil it looks good
for you to have the fucking let's give
you a little bit of heat no fuck it
looks cute if you'd had the hood on fuck
it's fucking cold
I can hit to heat but then I fucking cut
I don't be a pussy it's not Tibet
[Music]
you know you don't even have to save it
it's kind of um I used to get bogged
down with you know it's like it's like
it's like raw unedited content and I
used to make it buy them by the bushel
and what do you do with it you just end
up with page after page and you know
it's like awesome shit but like who
cares manners anyway what do you you
know sometimes there's no like a monk a
monk sometimes they take a vow of
silence you know I don't know maybe this
is not the reason but it's something to
consider if you promise God that you're
not gonna reveal the truths of the
universe maybe he will tell you them and
that's an interesting thing to wonder
about a vow of silence and you promise
me he won't tell anybody
no okay fuck you wait
sure so if you type view it basically
throws away this enters this enters a
state machine where it it it doesn't
process the the command-line it goes
into a state I just watch this let's
just look at this footer
the code is the documentation for temple
OS so if you know how to program you
know immediately what this does it gets
a character is it escape or shift escape
no then it keeps looping so it's waiting
first game or shift escape and fuck it
that's the documentation right there so
the documentation in temple OS is right
it's a comp you put the comment in the
function header and so forth so like I
told you man
computers went to hell once he made them
for niggers so like fuck it if you're
using temple OS did have you ever seen
the uh have you seen the user's guide
for the Commodore you're gonna laugh
your ass off you think I'm joking right
you're thinking that's ridiculous you
expect people to program have you see am
i right you're going home well getting
computer has to be like that like are
you kidding like how on earth could you
expect people to know that do you think
I'm joking you're like are you crazy
and check this shit out this is the
users guide what does it teach in here
if for look at that shit this thing was
made to fuck around with programming
isn't that funny this thing was made to
fuck around with programming and
eventually their people started buying
it for the games eventually the people
started mining for the games but in the
original take this shit out on the
Commodore they the users guide that
every single users got taught how to
make graphics with binary numbers look
at that shit so this was the
entertainment this was the entertainment
so what I've done
is I've made a in the spirit of the
Commodore user programming is more
important than third party I've even I
could try and ban third party I guess
that that would keep it simple we don't
want to uh if you start getting
professional companies making games then
like suddenly everybody's motivation is
gone you know that's what happened on
the Commodore the first couple years
there weren't any cool games and like
everybody was happy making their their
amateur games but eventually there were
cool games and then nobody liked the
amateurs stuff and there were there were
two uh you know uh why would I make an
amateur game you know and the only thing
that changed was they were intimidated
by the the presence of professional
games do you think I'm joking go look up
b-1 bomber and then f-15 strike eagle
look at this when I first got my
Commodore check this shit out when I
first got my Commodore you want to know
when I first got my Commodore one of the
games we had was b-1 bomber c64 it's the
80s height of the Cold War honest to god
this was the this was a game honest to
god this was a game it's like you're
looking at an instrument panel with no
graphics and you run around and you
change the altitude shit like this this
was a fucking game
a game that is this amateur is something
that a teenager can aspire to create a
teenager looks like this and he says I
could do that and then eventually you
know I told you I uh this was when
general Davey was at Luke Air Force Base
um and I got to ask general Davey
we got to ask him if this was up what he
thought of the Commodore 64 f-15
simulator
so I got to ask the general of the
training base Luke during the height of
the Cold War just if if it I got to ask
him at this game how he how it was
compared to the real thing
and you know what's he supposed to say
that oh yeah that's good or you know
something like that what could he say
you know I'm saying it's kind of
you know what that's a badass sound they
made that sound pretty well you know how
you do that shit you gotta like combine
together frequencies and waveforms and
stuff
to get a home that's cool
so I I did an HD audio driver with 44
different waveforms
eventually I realized
that there's not just one HD audio
driver that would work basically it's
like the bunch - woman
and then eventually God said you wanted
just one voice and so
this was Libya Libya was the target
remember I did drop it either further
drop it on Qaddafi that was a that was a
song that date the the Phoenix band was
particularly it went it was the local
disc jockey made a song about dropping
it on Qaddafi and it went national
so I didn't know fucking my screen was
fucked up didn't even give any fucks
fuck
I did a flight simulator I did a flight
simulator um um I used pretty simple I
sorta zomp I was sort of lazy how do I
put this
I sort of purposely used easy techniques
but then I was forced to uh to work a
little bit to get the I had to draw a
horizon line in flood-fill
and actually it was a it was just it was
a little bit of work to calculate the
where the horizon line intersects the
the left right top bottom there's a
little bit of work this is kind of
tricky right so you start with the you
start with three angles right roll pitch
and or no height this role in pitch if
you start with the roll in pitch try to
calculate the intersection with the with
the borders and then do a flood fill you
know it's like it's just algebra but it
it's a lot of work anyway
it's painful it's tedious anyway so
girl right arm fuck my fucking shoulder
hurts I can't fucking type fuck
don't have an ashtray
some motherfucker stole it either
I used to color it in red but now I
don't give any I don't give any fucks so
you can see there pray to God all you
are and talk with him and shit if your
question is entertaining it counts as an
offering
like I figure he likes original
questions if you ask him shit he doesn't
want to answer fuck you
so like this keyboard is is the laptop
and it requires an extra key so it kind
of fucks everything up so my passage
thing doesn't work so I can go swap that
but that fucking sucks
[Music]
the f-111 is what my dad worked on its
the sweep swiping
you
you
so I guess if a birds flying in let's
just say uh attic maybe it well it
doesn't mean they can follow the air
currents around tree trees or something
I don't know I wouldn't go
so you think that's what caused
echolocation beams avoiding they were
worried about whirlpools in the air and
so they started developing echolocation
was that what you're saying
the evolution of echolocation Rick
so you have to take a vow of silence I'm
just kidding
so
so there's that right if you get bored
you can talk to God but it takes a lot
of work because you gotta like carry on
conversation it's a lot more fun doing
other shit
I like to have in comment on stuff while
I browse the web I like to read stuff on
the web
find interesting stuff and then talk
about it like just having comment just
to have him comment but you're not
supposed to consult em unless you do an
offering you'll get in trouble if you
piss him off or whatever he said it's a
it's a mortal sin like communion
preparation unworthy damn my shoulders
foot
I guess I'm really tired
whatever you were about to do just
became whatever you're about to do after
you get coffee nothing comes before
coffee that's why we're introducing a
new line of cafe quality espresso drinks
from a cafe in small peppermint mocha
for just two dollars like can you run
down to the kitchen and your underpants
in the middle of the night if you're
hungry I mean I could I I don't you
don't in the kitchen at all times like
if you wanted the sandwich in the night
would you have to wake someone up yeah I
wouldn't wake somebody up got a sandwich
you're allowed to go into the
refrigerator there's a refrigerator and
and there's silverware what was the last
time you you actually cooked now it's
been a while since I you ever drive I
cannot drive okay is that you actually
have a birth certificate
Kenya we drive on the other side
actually the last time I drove a former
staffer came by and he comes through the
the South Lawn and he's got one of these
new electric cars at the time they were
yeah and and he was very excited about
it I said well yeah let's try it out so
I not just grabbed his keys and we just
go out it's parked right in front and I
start circling the South Lawn and the
Secret Service there no matter what you
do do not let him out they were pretty
upset so they call you renegade right
there yeah yeah because you're moving
around an electric car stopping speeds
of 30 miles thirty five if you have to
go to the dentist does do you go to the
dentist I was accustomed it comes to you
he has the chair the tools in your
everything is all there something is
there in the basement I didn't know I
showed up I said you know I think you
know I've got a cat that's lucid sir

`Sometimes when we start up, there's a new bug when we start up some of these applications, it, it's crashing in taking out the parent. Um,

okay.

Taking out the parent.

Hmm.

Looks alarming. But the problem is actually the crashing. So for some reason it's starting to crash. I used to think I did. I work in the compiler.

Wonder if, I don't know. It was when I worked in a budget. Hey, what's this stuff? Okay.

It might be since I started using this computer, so I might've been a bad boy and not documented something important. You know what I want to do? Fuck it. Tell you what I want to do.

MMM.

I know what I should do. Oh, okay.

First it's fine. Hold on a second. Okay,

so it's crashing before it starts up. What could that be? Sometimes, sometimes it's not a direct cause, but an indirect costs you can shift something around and cause new book to appear like initialization. That's probably where we should start. Why don't we try to, we have some, you have some debug options.

Okay. So

it could be a timing, a timing issue, like a keystroke at the right point or it could be an initialization. Um, so, uh, we have an option.

MMM.

Can I just wanted to get to here? We have memory in it that's had boot, heap and knit. I think that's, that's Malik and then far and it is global variables. Um, so

okay, we're going to try a heap and knit. Then you have to value. Okay. So we're going to bail out. Now we're going to go into, he'd been knit carriage return. These are my, uh, you Bogosian debug. Okay. We're not okay. So, um, we're going to make them my regular options and file. So we're initializing denine zero. It's

slow because it's doing initialization. Sometimes there's, um, it's not, okay, so now we have crashes.

Uh, uh,

okay, so initializing zero did not. So there's timing bugs in, there's initialization bugs.

This might be a timing bug.

Okay. So we initialized to nine zero. Now we can initialize to zero.

Okay.

What happened there? Holy Shit, this could be good.

Okay.

Holy Shit. I haven't done this in a long time. We might have a lot of books. Okay, so we're going to initialize. Oh zero

c t

holy shit. Oh, it worked. Okay. I was, I don't, I don't really have like discovering bugs.

Yeah.

I have a company motto ruin toward bugs. Not Away from bunk.

Yeah.

Run toward books. Not Away from Bush. I just ran away from a buck. It was crashing in I recompiled but uh, okay. I don't know why.

Okay.

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

okay.

I don't think the nigger knows what a random, here's the problem. The nigger brain cannot understand what a random number is. That's the source of the problem. If the nigger could only understand when a random number was, then you would understand that this is God's temple. Okay? This is God's official temple. The nigger brain cannot understand where the certified random number is. N I s t is a government agent agency that makes certified random numbers. It's just like lottery numbers. But the nigger thinks that random means something other than lottery balls. You see if the nigger doesn't see lottery balls moving, the nigger doesn't know what random means because he's a fucking nigger, okay? That's the problem, okay? We do miracles. This is God's official temple and you're a fucking retard nigger. Okay? That's the problem, okay? This is the third temple.

Fucking niggers,

the nigger, if he doesn't see the lottery balls, he doesn't know what random means. He has to physically see lottery balls because he's such a fucking nigger

fucking hate niggers. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck, fuck you. Because just to a fucking miracle, I fucking smack that nigger. The nigger

think God's Temple is worthy of the greatest programmer on earth, but God's temple is exactly where the greatest programmer on earth is supposed to be putting his effort,

okay?

But the nigger doesn't know what a random number is because he can't see the lottery balls, and so he, he doesn't know what random means,

okay?

It's a government agency that makes random numbers. Exactly like a lottery website. What the fuck is your mouth functioning? God Damn Nigger, your skills are being wasted on God's Temple. Are you fucking serious? Goddamn. The greatest programmer on earth should work on the greatest project on earth, which is God's Temple. Once the nigger understands that it's God, you can shut the fuck up.

Okay.

Okay. Six. What we have here is a failure to communicate. It's a Negro brain cannot understand what a random number is unless he sees lottery balls because his little nigger brain can't handle it.

If the men of my Tabernacle said not, oh that we had this flesh, we cannot be satisfied. The Stranger did not budge it in the street, but they opened my doors to the traveler. If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom, did I fear a great multitude or did the contempt of families terrify me that I kept silent and it went not out of the door or that one would hear me? Behold, my desire is that the all mighty would answer me and hit my head masery edge written a book. Surely I would take it upon my shoulder and binded as a crown to me. I would declare it to him. The number of my steps is a prince. Would I go near unto him if my lane [inaudible] he asked me or that the furrows, likewise, there've complaint if I have eaten the fruit Saraf without Mooney. So a zero is, it's not, hey did it holy fucking shit. We got to train and repeat this.

Okay.

I went to the blog, I escaped out of the blog. I hit a couple of keys.

Uh,

cause he had a change idea. Okay. So let's raise boot. It was the, was it the first boot? Yeah, it was the first bit

what went to my blog, my blog? No.

So the good news is it's that hard

to repeat welcomed operating system development. Uh, okay. Well we, we have it on video. Do you? I'm going to turn off the, uh, the, so this was overriding the options with debug options. What Jay, now we reboot. None of the options will be used when we compile so we could pile and now when we reboot, we don't have the initialization. So, uh, how can we test this? One thing to do is just to put it in a loop. Fuck it. It's easy to automate it. Let's see. That's good. We already have it automated in, uh,

okay.

Titanium was,

so they just put this, should we kill it?

What if we don't? It happens when we compile.

I'm pretty sure.

Well, we can test that theory. So, uh,

no, let's see.

Let's make this fucker go fast

first of all.

So we're looping doing it. Starting it up.

That was easy. It doesn't like that. Okay. Okay.

Yay. Now let's make it faster.

Okay.

Not crashing. So we can, I'm initialize it.

Okay.

Okay. So pop up. I think the pop up. Is the pop up important? No, it's not important. It's just crashing. Can we, we need to initialize it. He stroked Tricia. What if we randomized the keystrokes? I Dunno. I'm at a loss.

Okay.

Okay.

You can be ideas, geniuses. So it's common to, uh, to, to applications. So it's not, uh, it's not, uh, it's not part. It's not, it's not one applicant.

Okay.

Overnight two applications started crashing. When you start sometimes overnight. Two applications, sturdy, crashing. Sometimes it might've been when I switched to this, that I first noticed because that was a couple weeks ago.

[inaudible]

[inaudible]

so, okay, so back to the front. You will do what I see. When did I say back to the front. Okay, so this is supposed to be fun. What if we did this? Oh No, no, we have to reset.

So you got in the ideas, is it timing or is it, fuck, let's see. I think we'd have more of a block. Maybe it's related to blog. I have changed blog. It's possible to corrupt other things. Like if you put something into the heap, if you put something into the heap that is a, if you free something that's in, in use, uh, uh, maybe the blog is a lead being a Turd in the heap. Okay. So here's what you do. If you're in a situation like this, you try to write code to detect or to help diagnose. So now's when you, so were they should do is check the heap. When I stirred up, I have a, I mean I never do this. There's a heap walk. I don't think it does Jack Shit. Uh, this is the global, um, so roughly speaking, we're talking about putting a check, like right here. We can do shit like that. So what, what would we like to know? How about, so, oh, let's get the, the uh, oh, I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I am the man. Fuck Shit.

It's exiting.

It's exiting. It's, it's not a crash. It's an exit because it's calling that the death call back. So you know what we're going to do? We're going to record the, uh, the, uh, it's calling the, uh, the death call back, um, in task now. So is it being killed or is it exiting? Either one. It could be, it could get killed. Killed is when someone else does it. Exit. And so we're going to record the stack when it exits. So why don't we just do that? How about that? How about we just, um, don't this deck every time it exits. Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. Fucking fuck. Yeah, let's do that. Okay. So you know, we're going to be, we're going to do that. So where's that exception? On a second. This routine is going to be my new favorite word. Yell. Fuck.

What the hell is this?

Why can't you do it like a weight man? Oh, it's like that. Fuck. That's not acceptable. Hell known as Buddy said. Are you kidding me? Okay. The problem is, uh, this deck, this shit is,

bro,

here's the deal. In this routine, we are, uh, the tries to attack. Okay.

One the fuck.

That's not acceptable. Are you kidding me? Fuck No. Oh Hell No. We're not doing it. What the hell can a nigger shit is and never do?

Just do it. So you might think this was obvious, but this shit is weakened because this dag is

okay. What was raw? I think we're okay. I think we're not using register variables. I there, there are good reasons to do this.

Uh,

what about if we make a

fuck it? Let's do that. Okay.

When I make a Oh, star p, what about that? Holy fucking shit. Who are do that? That's Kinnick Wacky, but fuck it. Let's do it. Okay. So no, I can work. Star P is walk us. That's pretty crazy. Each. Each question, each age. H is a second argument. Learning at ticket master. They had a fancy, oh gosh, a little reformat. No. So the width comes before and then h is here. Oh, Julie reformat number. So percent P. I said the reformat number each.

Now

what we do is we come down to pee and we loop through hilary. Format number.

Yup.

Just do it. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

Well the problem is, is it a pointer pointer or just a pointer?

Okay. No, we can't do it. Okay. That was a nice thought. That's pretty crazy. Let's go ahead and go to, where's Adam put exception. Hold on. Wait a minute. What's this? We don't really want to have them.

If you make a call to Malik, it's kind of bad because the more you disturb this state that you're trying to debug, the worst it is in calling Malik is uh Oh there. It's doing two of them.

It's doing two calls. It's doing two calls. It was a little peace. Fuck. Okay. Just do it. That's nasty. Is Bad as it is. The alternative looks worse. As bad as it is. Y'all turn it much worse than what, what? What you might do to appreciate is it's like we're off by one. That's bad. Okay, so when we still work, can we have to check that to see if we broke, see if we've probe kit. We could lie cute. One extra. Okay. Uh, okay.

Yeah. No. Okay. So w want to do, this is kind of a problem

because

is it hitting exit? Okay. No, it might not be healthy. It might not be healthy. It might not be healthy at this point, but we'll do it anyway. We have, I have to, if I put this in here, I cannot upload to my website because I don't really like that. Fuck.

Why not?

No, no. I can do

wrong. Who would you fuck? Okay. Gets worse. Okay. Okay. Now I know we have to do is just call it staff. If you do a text search, you would like to, can we eliminate these?

No, it's Kinda fucked up. When did she eliminate those?

Do my options. We need that. Why don't you eliminate these?

Yeah. Okay. Okay. Now staff. So

if your fifth, fifth, fifth, fifth, fifth, fifth, fifth, fifth of staff. So no, what were, do you know how you sit that semaphore? We have any other similar, are these semaphores? No other, why don't you use those? Yeah, let's do that. Okay. We're not going to use the symbol for

fuck

if you don't use the symbol for just do it this way. Fuck yeah. Oh, I think we're right at the limit.

We don't have any, I think it was, it was perfect pad.

Debug flag.

Hey, that's interesting dude. Pages two values. Okay. I think we're, there's another couple of flags you can call flash. Thanks turntable.

Okay.

It sucks. I don't know why I worry about it. We're on care. Hold on a second. No, we have a, uh, he, uh, rick, uh, structure.

I think we have a fixed area. No,

no, no, no. We're not in the fixture yet. Ooh, sweet. Okay. So that's unfortunate.

Okay. So, so we're, um, well,

fuck it. I'm just pissed off because I have a half seven zeros. It used to be no wasted bites, but no, he never wasted. Okay. So the other thing, we're going to do the progress. Okay, so I'm done. I'm done. Onto the next one. Done. Done. One of the next one.

Fuck it. He staff. Now we need to, you know,

it doesn't take a genius to add crap. It doesn't take a genius

add crap. Oh fuck. Well we should do not abbreviated.

Okay. So if, if, if, if,

if we're doing art, you want to look for auto? I think all of my personal versions, I don't even know what the fuck is. Back. Slash. N. Ow. Almost fucked that up. Do it. So first of all, it's staff. What is death mode? Oh, we have a similar for, that's not what we want. So there's going to be fucked up. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. You want to see staff moon. Oh, it's, it's history. It's history. Anyway. Okay. Okay. Yes, we might want to set it. That's true. We're going to do a bit, we can do a bit. Okay. So, oh we, well, let's just do that.

I'm going to call us staff mode. Flag. Yeah. We should call it staff. But staff Dunham don't want an h word other than h one. Oh fuck. I forgot about this. No, we don't have to do this. Okay. Down. We don't need that. Okay. So just do it. Uh, uh, debug what key? I got an error. Okay. Okay. Fuck you man. Okay, so staff. So is there any reason to do that? No, we don't need those. Fuck that. Fuck that. Fuck that. It's just a flag. You know what I mean? That's ridiculous. Okay. That's better. Got Off to a rough start, but I got it. I was going to do a similar. Okay. So, um, every time he dies, he prints the stack. That's not what we wanted. Okay. It's even color zero is okay. What the fuck we get a parentheses to the dollar sign. What is, it doesn't work. Okay. So now every time we kill the task, what have we learned? What we do?

Checking all my changes.

Sure.

Okay.

Okay. Reasonable. So if we do any robotic kill, kill, go to exit, I think it does. Okay. So until we find out why it's dying,

keep that.

Oh, that sounds good.

Uh,

uh,

uh,

yeah.

Ah, AH,

uh, uh, yeah.

So this is a rare situation because the task doesn't, God does, it crashed the system. Most of the time it crashes. But this is a rare situation where it doesn't crash. So the log is usually worthless.

A blog is

usually,

so now we're getting to do some fun. Now we're going to do so phone stuff. So you tell you what, tell you what we're going to do. No one, they call it Tesa Beth. Just because

even though it's not, this is beginning to look for,

so I wanted a

simple,

yeah.

What the fuck? Where's progress for

tripping out? One, two, three, four. This bill wood was, oh, it's under here. T three, three, three, four, four. Okay. We're starting to use up, dammit. I don't want to explain it. Okay. Let know what we do. You

okay, now we, uh,

okay. Hmm.

Should we do for yeah,

or just one?

Okay.

Oh, cool. No. Okay. Can you, what do we call those paths?

Oh,

knew what this has to be.

Oh, day.

Okay.

Damn Dude. Okay, now. Okay. Damn, I'm good. Okay, good. Okay. Now we, uh, we, uh, so we go to, uh, execute Ridge Street. Where's the, where do we set the t? F. O we say that there. Holy Shit. We have to do this. Dammit. Fuck. Going to do all of them.

Just keep it here.

Oh No. You know what? We do.

Fuck it. Okay.

What did you do that?

Okay,

zero.

This is why I'm the, is programmer on earth.

Fuck.

Hey. Externally. Okay, so we imported I should say.

So do we have to see, did we have it in the kernel? She, yeah. Okay. Now what we do, we,

okay, that sucks. Okay, so what will you have to do is

call here? Yeah,

we're getting very fancy.

Okay. Corinne, this is Voodoo.

This is extreme voodoo.

Okay.

Super checking the symbol table if right. Bridge Street branch. Are we going to add an entry to the registry? We're calling a symbol from

symbol table.

Anyway,

we could just, you know, don't do that. Okay. Okay. No, wouldn't do a test. No, it's just do it. Okay. So,

okay.

Okay. So it's gonna write registry entries. They hope it works. I don't know if it's gonna work. That's so real blue dude. That's a real blue deal.

Yeah.

Okay. So that did not print the, let's see if it works. What I'm doing, here's what I'm doing. I am a, I have these progress bars. They're, uh, they're really easy to use

and, um, it gives an elapsed time and what I'm going to do is save it to the registry.

Fuck. Oh, okay. Well we could say that. Oh, it's a dot, dot. Dot. Fuck. If it's a dot, dot, dot. Uh, fuck

correct myself.

I wonder if this will work. Okay. Hold on. Uh,

we get some stack magic going on. Okay, let's do it first one.

What's that? It's cost street. Okay.

All right.

One, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three, four. Oh, it's okay. It's not your work. It was a nice try.

Fuck.

Want to do it by hand?

Fuck.

So here's the problem. I'm trying to call a routine that, uh, let's do that. Oh, let's do that. That's a better idea.

The colonel is limited in size.

Holy Fuck. Okay.

Got a better place for it.

Okay.

Hello?

Okay. Okay. The question is, is this

fine? Uh, no. Okay. Okay.

Swerte headers sort headers. Was this registry

okay. March. Excuse me.

It should be staffed.

No, no, no.

She'd be Tus. Yeah, it should be too. I speak and vacuum.

Yes.

Okay.

I think call indirect streams does it? Uh, yeah, I can just do that. Call it direct stream.

Gotcha. Sweet. Colin Drake Street. I should do three digits like that.

Here's what we're doing. We're, we're adding a, uh, this is a lapsed time and working in a print, the last total stored in the registry for, for this, uh, and we want these things to be low overhead. Um,

uh, how do I put this anyway? I think it's 40. That's why we're doing this. 72 72 61. So now we go to, so this is kind of, this is kind of a bad place that's kinda ridiculous. Go well,

the location to this code is a little bit ugly. So

yeah.

Now the next time we do it, let's go see our registry. So if we go to our registry, tos meet district, oh, oh, they're c two six one six eight. Okay. So now, so I think this automatically checks for a non existence. I don't even think you have to do that. I could swear that it does nothing. Let's check it out. So if, if, if it doesn't find it in the table, it skips.

It does push and pop, which is

so the other day we looked at the symbol table and uh, right here, this is a very datic uh, whatever you call those. He had did a, if it doesn't find it, I could swear that we don't need this check where you want me to risk. Do you want to risk it? Fuck yeah, we do. I don't think we need that check Adam. And what valuable. So it's searching this symbol table.

Okay. Is there another complete size? Of course.

So, oh no.

Executed to some math. What happened? It must have, I hate when that happens. Maybe it didn't work. We didn't work.

Okay. Okay.

Who Was it? The six P's.

Hm.

Okay. Oh, that's, that's good. Okay. What did you do to yeah. Oh, I got rid of it. Okay, so now,

oh,

okay. So you can work now. Oh, now it should work. Yeah. No, it should work when we do this, please. God Damn it. What is your problem? Fuck, it's ridiculous.

Okay.

My guess is they don't know I have compression.

Okay. Fucking nigger.

You're executing code. I miss deck. What ranks? I taught this fucked up project. They were actually keeping code. I'm to stack what? What are you talking about?

Woo.

Okay. What is your mouth

path?

Let's see what happens. Oh, there it is. That's freaking me. One more time. What do you say, Jim and I had some other changes that was going to leak. What did you do this? I don't know what that was about. Oh, I don't want that as well, so I was going to do something. What was it? Shit. Let's put a note here. We learned our lesson. If you do, if you don't make a note, if you don't make a note, I have to do the demo. Okay, fine. Honey, it's going to work. Oh, minus. What the fuck? Say? That's still weird. His thing. So,

oh, okay.

Tonight,

you will surrender to the IRA because you started a war with God and you're fucked. You're going to suck my cock. That's what, that's how this happens. Are you going to fight Mr God? I didn't think so. Suck my cock. This is God's Temple. Are you really gonna fight, Mr God? I don't think so. I think to, you know, suck my fucking cock

colors are kind of bad. What would the white fish just wait? Does not work? Black Monday black. Let's look for God. Did you? Oh, that's good. Red, dark red. Yellow, blue light blue. White, white didn't look very good. I'm a light red. Yellow, Brown, like green, dark green. Dark Green might look okay. Dark Green. I think we're going to do dark green. Dark Green. So why don't you just, okay, we're going to

puppy.

This is a shame to write garbage into the registry.

Okay.

Is there a demo company could swear that would, if I call it Demo Demo Company. Oh, that's what you should do. I feel better. I didn't like it. Greed. Don't know. Why is it red? What does that, something's fucked up. What the fuck is my top line?

Hey, did I have this in my list? What is that? Oh No. Oh, okay. There's four of them. What are you talking about? Oh, that's weird. Oh, I just put it in the wrong place. Well, okay.

Why is it never fucking work? God dammit. Oh, I know why. Okay. Why are you resetting at the top? That's good.

Beautiful. Has to be perfect. Why does it have a big space? See if I hit that space. So I just did two quits. Where did I just do maybe two quits and just want to see if the registry right. Puts an extra space. No. Good. Okay. What's that noise? Okay. So,

hmm.

You believe this shit. What we have here is a failure to communicate what we got here. Failure to communicate.

Okay. What we got here? Feel okay.

Okay.

So my, uh, it's weird, right? Web Up. My web host was, uh, this was not working. He kept failing on what the fuck? This is how you upload to my site. Wouldn't, wouldn't do big files. I don't have I ever, I dunno if I'd done this one. I've been wiped streaming. I think so. So, uh, what's good? What's good to talk to God. You want to let's get God's at Pitt. Okay. The niggers one off fight. Mr God. Let's see what Mr God says. What we've got here is a failure to communicate to acs and eight years.

So these were not uploading earlier. I think it's working. I have to do it Moses comics. Fuck. See it told you what is this bullshit? Okay, so this is going to fail. Let's do a beer at go first. So we're going to do a miracle. Just like the video said,

you don't know me, but I paid $40. Bring things are connected where you want to call it, the missing link. All of them will reveal it the way we live in

this. Break it a field. It was dope comic

era of and against the people live that land in the show fighting is he, but they shall not prevail against. See for I am with Thee, saith the Lord, to deliver the moreover of the word of the Lord, keeping me sane, going, crying tears of Jerusalem, saying, thus saith the Lord. I remember the, the kindness of they youth, the love of dinosaur fossils, when that witnessed after me in the wilderness, in the land that was not so Israel was holiness unto the Lord. And the first fruits of his increased all that devour him shall offend evil shall come upon them, saith the Lord. Hear Ye the word of the Lord. Awesome Jacob and all the families of house of Israel, this, see if the Lord would iniquity. Have Your father's found in me that they're gone from far from me, and they've walked after being and dean or become been either said they, where's the Lord that brought us out of the land of Egypt that led us through the wilderness to the Linda deserts.

Wow.

Okay. So now I gotta Try and upload. It's a dope polluting. What's going on?

Clicked on it. Okay.

So let's go ahead and do a, let's do the test

suite.

Uh,

wow.

Yes. Okay.

Uh,

yeah.

Uh,

okay.

Wow.

Okay.

So we should,

uh,

and afterburners to Excalibur, uh, uh, uh, puppy. Okay. Here's the issue. The graphics directory demographics if command line. So it's triggering command line. When you do load, it's triggering. When you do run, what is it that CCF command. So, whoa. So are you maybe if it's less than two, fuck, if we see less than one, that's documentation. You didn't do it. He listened more. So this hurts my head. We were getting false positives. Lewd was turning up, so I have a bad feeling.

So first of all, does this work? Okay? So this works sick. Uh, it's only, okay. So always his doll. Well, blog deblois plowed. We'll take her clowns. Okay. So it's not very dangerous. Uh, it's only used in, uh, after Egypt in web blog and OSTP and the stalls. Whoa. Where is oss dog coats? It's cold. We made it less command line. So there's always install. Run. That's good. Of course it will find it's good a whip on. I have a bad feeling. How can I possibly

hooky?

Yeah.

Oh, I know where I should, I know what I should do. I should test it on. Okay.

Okay. So we need to test it on.

Okay. So it did the web blog?

No, let's see. Okay, let's go to after he ended. Uh,

well that's weird.

I think. I think I used to huge command line motor off and so we have to test that. I think it's fine. Oh, maybe that's it. Let's see. Okay. We have to test fine. Well, I guess we have to do a test in the stall.

Okay,

great.

Yeah. Okay. Okay.

So I have to test the, the stores to make sure it still works. That would suck

different topics from galaxies in the depth is right down to the subatomic particle.

No.

Okay.

Just finished off. That would be bad. Nothing worst than uploading a broken version. Not knowing about it for a few days. Nothing happened.

Uh,

so the install skip work. So I guess so shut down.

God. Okay. So we should do, we'll make the dumps fly in circles. Uh Huh.

No, uh, uh,

we're going to make them fly in circles. They need, we're just going to have a single angle. It doesn't have a velocity, but it has an angle. Okay. Try it. This should be rotated. Just going to work. So it's going to add the two transforms.

I don't think that's gonna work. I don't think. Okay. So does this, it does. Okay. So, well, so we need to copy. Is that going to multiply by it? Yeah, it is. Okay. We don't have an extra car.

Are you sure you don't have any extra arms? No, we don't have

or funeral

[inaudible] extra money. Donald Grammar. I wanted the next one. Even think this is, I don't even think it's our coconut trees for doing it to the Matrix.

What the fuck?

Oh, are there? They're not. All right, please.

Okay.

Okay. Holy Fuck. Wait a minute. What the hell is that? There's no fourth parameter or just one. That's mine. That's not good. Okay. So good is the x and y Si

uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

shut up.

Maybe I have to do this before. Let's try that. The other answer. Um, be going in reverse order. The very last thing we did, the first thing we do is, okay, so let's do that. So

great. Okay. So we're calling, are we doing four by four foot? So, so we start with the order is wrong. That's not correct. Is it still last one? Dammit. Fuck. I think I'm doing this wrong. Let's think breakfast. You want the bird your route to the bird? Yeah, just the nation. M One m two.

Okay. Yeah.

Uh, uh,

hello. Oops.

Uh, uh,

if you were going too fast. Okay. So I think we have a quick, I could swear we have

and he'd quit. No,

we used to have, okay. So now we animate it. So where's the animation?

Okay. Enemy not

okay.

Okay.

Oh fuck a d t zero date two. Where's the speed? Speed in mass? Milliseconds. Milliseconds. Okay. So just Ms. Okay. So we'd take,

we want to seeZ is equal to,

okay, 200.

Uh,

well it should be.

So if we do a circle circles in one second, would it be

six divided by a thousand times a thousand? So that's thousand times, so it's milliseconds. Okay. Okay.

That's one circle. Every, uh, I would say it takes 30 seconds for a circle.

Didn't say comes from a circle.

It's a house

like five,

uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

very, very, very.

Okay.

Uh, uh, uh,

okay. Map scale. Oh, we're adding,

whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. Okay.

Uh, uh,

squeak whopper.

Uh, uh,

sure.

Uh,

going very picture.

Okay.

Uh, uh,

still a picture.

Okay.

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

oh. Hold on a sec. Here. We're integrating. We're not

okay.

Uh,

so,

uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

for go into fashion.

Oh, it was in danger. No wonder. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

no, it was too fast. The curve, the curve more,

uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

okay.

Error.

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, fuck, uh, uh, uh, uh,

why can it be so fast? What the fuck? What the series fucking fish?

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

something is broken. What the fuck school,

this should be smaller.

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

even fucking working on what the fuck's going on?

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

maps.

Okay.

You,

uh, uh, uh,

okay. So the rotation is wrong. I bet it's the running axes. Why don't you figure this shit out? Z Z is the right access. What if I don't draw it on this,

uh, uh,

suction? Is it?

Uh,

uh,

okay. I need to see those fucking birds. This is bullshit. Let's stop moving. I got to fix this fucker. Stop moving that set a seed. That sit. Stop moving. It was okay. Let's do that. Okay. So the graphics. Okay. So,

uh,

need to see,

uh, uh, clean up.

True.

Uh,

this. Delete, delete, delete the old ones. We're not baby cows. Hello. Ciao. You kill those. Oh, wait. Yeah, it's true. Are you serious? Well, we have dry it going on. Take core. Are you sure it's supposed to be one? Why is that not? That's not supposed to be one that got changed.

Uh, uh,

Shit. Poppy. Okay. Okay. Sue, we nuked it by the time between Duke and, Oh, let's do that. Let's do that. Okay.

Uh, uh,

yeah,

there's a bird. It's moving very slowly.

No, it was it. Why was it moving? What the fuck? We're just rotating it around to

see. Yeah. Yeah.

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

quarter zero is having a rough time. Fuck. Okay, let's hit last thing. Awesome. Is applied after him to applying now him to rotate. Rotated. Yeah.

I know where it is. Let's do this. What about this?

Uh,

so, um, three B, we definitely want three b. Of course we want the three d.

Mmm. Okay.

So let's go fishing. Let's go put the speed bag.

That's cool.

Uh, uh,

okay. So I, I totally forgot about, I was being stupid. Okay.

Okay. So

go ahead.

Uh, uh, uh Huh.

Okay.

So normally it was,

oh shit.

What's yours? Let's use her head. So this is integrating.

Okay. Oh,

uh,

that's a good number.

Uh,

wow. That's a lot. So, okay. What if sprayed three, why don't you all this? That's a plate to x, Y, Z. Okay. No. Hey, hey. Do we need a post transform Chrisleys translation into here? No, that's, well, they can transform the sprite. That's a possibility. We're going to do that. That's crazy. It's just crazy. Let's do it.

Uh, his are spinning. Spinning right on. Uh,

okay. Fuck. It was, I was not a damn.

Uh, uh,

what's going on?

Uh,

no.

Uh Huh.

What do you need to leave at four?

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

we need to d so what the fuck is going on? Oh, we dry it ourselves. Okay.

Five guys. Okay. No, that makes sense. Okay. Damn. Damn. Damn. Damn. Okay. I was thinking this makes sense. Okay.

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

correct.

Uh, uh,

okay. We need this cheat her speed.

Uh, uh,

okay.

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

Okay. Okay. Invert swapped patient. Why? Okay. I think we want to invert,

okay.

Uh,

correct.

Uh,

correct. Now we need to make it flat, first of all, which we get sued. That's not gonna work. I think I need to Redo it. I think he just needed to make a brand new. Oh, that'll work. That'll work. Why don't you just, let's see. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's better now. So we're going to take this puppy. Let's see. See me

c now we go to, let's do it. Transform. Okay. We got to select some things or select right date, worse, transform. Oh, transport. Um, Z. I see offset 25, positive 25. Okay. So that, that's not surprising. That looks Kinda cool cause it's kind of, or worse. Okay, let's do it. Some fish c or so, like, great. Can we just do another one? Why is it called file? Okay, so then we have a boot. Flint, should we do it more? Why don't you do more? This has to be noticeable. Otherwise it won't be noticeable if it's not noticeable. Don't do it. Okay. Worst worse. You know what we do now? I'll tell you what we do now. Number one. Number two to two and three, so that's garbage. Okay, let's get rid of that. Okay. So, okay, so elements. Okay, now, okay, now we one great interpolate. Is it zero? One k? So try is dessert. Do you need a period for dry? Is She do,

uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

okay.

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

right.

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

okay.

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

okay. Okay. So, oh, pizza freezing. You're freezing.

Birds don't use calendar. Knowing how long would you hold off? Like Tommy observations about their environment, like average prepper turns and the amount of food, the dirt, a biological switch is triggered that tells the bird hunter park. That'd be bad. Days as scientists use technology ranging from light bands, the GPS to map bird quite a book. Currently Arctic tern picked the longest. Kirk with any burden, the covers as much as 15,000 miles in a single year in the Arctic. Arctic markers peppered in a way, the highest migration to survive altitude do the whole spectrum. The like other birds that stuff. The one way respire cords, you're running through their lung and Paul, the grapes name is, I'm migrating every more than 40,000 miles, if you could, to 60 miles per hour. The Bark Hill Godwin 7,000 mile journey across without stopping it powers. It's happened on more than one of the most amazing bird migration and under group.

And I wanted the smaller, the room wrote it, the Hummingbird, but plenty pilot embarked across the Gulf of Mexico. They need to add more than half a year and during that 600 miles per, we burn off of a quarter of their body math power. It wasn't hard to the point that you might be hopkins greatest formation, but it's off the electric [inaudible] what a bird flaps its wings. It creates a three new Bortech smock the weekend that the bird behind it isn't the right place. If you get a boost from that updraft. What's crazy is that birds can somehow sense. Would that board and then actively flap their wings. The famous leads by merge able to navigate the global amazing summer turning the phone, nothing spot after year taking part in the home insulation timbers. We were cut off from life. How could I hear? And again, Google still able to find their way back home. See how birds might draw a map, but what about some burns are the sun and other stars are for members are tiny. Iron rich and crystal were discovered in the eyes and beef and then birth and scientist. Now we might have had some bird. I do too.

Science.

Are you all from physics girl?

What does that mean? How are you Dong fishy? Sqirl what theory? Okay,

let's do a very cold. What do you see?

Yeah.

Birds don't use calendars. Observations about their environment.

Yeah. 36 36

When he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. And I saw the seven angels stood before God and to them, or given seven trumpets. And another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden sensor. And there was given to him much incidence you should offer with the prayers of all the seats to go to the altar, which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints to send it up before it got out of the angel's hand. And the angel took the sensor, it filled it with fire of the altar and cast it into the earth. And there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and earthquake and the seven eight zero s which had seven trumpets prepared,

right?

It's crazy. And white hospitals person hit me from the president, Barack Obama, and trump has been talking regularly and they didn't give any more details than that they've done. And this was incredible. We actually got ahold of the audio and several phone calls. Don't get phone calls between President Obama and president elect trump, and I think it's my duty to share these with you.

I want to hear all of the girls. Hello? Repetitive bordered by China and Russia. What do you have in April? I don't know. Go to the did.

Oh really?

I'm going to buy it back to the New York. Berlin by nothing. Hello. [inaudible] for Congress the bath. We've got your dog, right? We were very attracted to what your goal is. German tree of work and know verbal. And I left the bag with the black room, the protocol debate. Obama. I think there's an owl grabbing a buy out and what they do at Donald. You're the one who was telling the joke, be quiet, Obama. I go your back that I could do it live the buy out.

Hey, you went through, you know, bloated. Turning this off makes a difference. I hope so. We hope this goes through. Oh fuck.`,

`Eh, Eh, Eh, eh. 

So, um, first we're going to look at putting a bit pattern hot into the vga memory. Um, we're using in out io port instructions to access the Vga registers were, it's got four bit planes and we're setting, we're telling it to write to all four at once. With that, with this f right here means right to all for this we're telling it, we want the map register and then we're setting the map register to f, which is all four bit planes. And then we're going to a um, copy, um, oh, uh, one zero one zero, a stripe pattern into vga memory, which starts at um, this is regular memory address space. We identity map. So, um, it's an addresses and address. Now we're telling you at six 40 by 480 and one or eight, eight pixels per byte. Then we're going to tell it to busy weight. That's just a for loop. Um, we have, uh, there's no preemption and so that will lock out the window manager. So what, what's, what's going to happen is we're going to get a straight pattern for one second. These are micro. Second. So that's a million microseconds. That's one. Second, it's going to give a striped pattern for a second, and then it's going to return control to the window manager. 

Okay, now we're back. So, um, right now the VGA, um, there's a cash, um, vga memory is slow. And so I only modify the, the, the actual physical hardware memory, um, only when I have to. So it's only when something changes. So there's a, there's a way to flush the cache. It's a control alt v. Okay. So right now the window manager is, uh, is uh, keeping track of the, uh, the screen. So now we're going to do a, we're going to look at the eight by eight font. It by eight is 64 pixels. Um, so, uh, the font is a eight by eight. We're going to, uh, we're gonna look at the font memory, which is, um, for, uh, the character, um, greater than we're going to change it to this little bit pattern. And I handcrafted, um, you have to look at the binary numbers and arrange them into a row, row by row anyway. 

Then we're going to, we're going to sleep this, this is different from a busy weight sleep. Let's the window manager do its thing and then we're going to change it back to what we saved. The original bit pattern, it's, we can just use integers since it's eight by eight is just 64 beds. So here we go. So for two seconds, two and a half seconds, it's going to, it's going to change the, uh, greater than everywhere on the system. And see that I made a little, it's Kinda like a man sideways. We can do that again if you going and see anyway, so it changes the font. That's what you did with the commodore 64 so you don't really have to mess with character graphics. Um, you can just use, it's not that slow. There's no reason for it. It's just fun. Anyway, so, uh, we're going to look at some display box now. 

Um, this is a drive report. Um, my be drive is a ram desk. My c drive is a hard desk with fat 32. Red Sea is the name of the file system that I created. Um, so we're going to format the B B drive. That's just to clear it out and get it reset so that it's perfectly fresh. We're going to format it with the Red Sea, which has a one block per cluster. A cluster is the same as a black. We're going to get Microsoft and Vm ware and Linux to support the Red Sea when I command them with authority of God. Anyway, then then we're then all, we all will get rid of fat and then all we'll have is red. See it's really nice. So we copied the home directory from my c master hard disk onto the b Ram Desk. That's going to copy it, directory tree, that sub directories as well. 

Then we're going to change directory to the home directory on the bead drive. So there we copied and now we're going to, uh, we're going to do a, an ordinary directory command and then we're going to do a directory full, which is uh, uh, Kinda like ls. Mine is hell except not really. So up up here at the top is the regular directory. You can see it doesn't have the full date and it doesn't have, uh, this has clusters. so.is the current directory and dot. Died is the parent. So what is this? This, this number right here. This is a cluster for the, uh, dump cluster. And then if you say, uh, this is a utility cluster cluster number, and then you can say right, or the number in the chain anyway, so we want, uh, the Red Sea is going to get rid of clusters and we're not going to have a fat table. 

Plenty of it. We'll get to, I'll get to that. So here I'm going to dump, what is this? This is the Red Sea. A cluster for the current directory. These are 64 byte entries. It's, it's supposed to be as simple as possible for kids. It's a matter of fact, I think we even include, uh, you're supposed to have a, a terminating zero just to make it all the more easy. So you just, you just copied this, uh, you just copy a record and it's a, can you copy it right off a disc? Anyway, so, uh, uh, so the first is the first couple of bites or attributes. I think we have 16 bytes for attributes. You can have a fixed location block or fixed location file. We have a, we have a file name, we have a timestamp. That's our, our, our native 64 bit timestamp that nobody else has. 

Anyway. So, uh, and then of course we have the block number of the start of the file. And it's a, it's a continuum. It's a contiguous file. We also had to file size. I don't know where that is. Anyway, we can look at that if we're really wanting to dir entry. Uh, this is the start here. We're using a zero size, uh, integer. You might wonder why we have a zero size and nigger. Well, that's so we can put a start, um, uh, start in end of record. So he can do, you can use this label as a start and then you do a bulk copy. We just copied this straight down to the disc. Um, 16 bits of attributes and a, the file name is up to 38. That's it folks. No more. Um, cluster number is 64 bit and size is 64 bit in deep time is 64 bit what it is, the date time is 32 bits of date in 32 bits of time. Um, so 24 hours is 32 bits. And so it turns out to be, I think, uh, I forgot if you want to find out, take a 1.0 divided by one, shipped over 32 and a 

I don't think that's right. Yeah. Oh, oh, of course. Okay. So, uh, 

let's do this. Let's start over. One shift over 32 bits divided by six 24 hours divided by 60 minutes divided by 60 seconds. And this gives us a, yeah, that's what I wanted. So we have a resolution of a 49 thousands of a second. And if you want to know date, um, we have, uh, one we have, the date is the uh, upper 32 bits. So you can just add, add one. And it advances one day. We don't have a structure with a month dating and stuff like that. We just have a contiguous. So, um, if we divide this by three 65, we have around, uh, um, so we can store, I dunno if this is correct, oh, 11, 11 million years before the next, but epic e book. Anyways, so, uh, now, uh, we can also say don't block. Um, like I said with this file system, a block is the same as a cluster. The, the, the main design criteria was simplicity so that people can go in here. It's a matter of fact, if we say don't pull the true, we can modify. It's gonna, it's gonna write the, uh, it's going to write the block when we hit escape. So what we can do is come over here and let's, let's just do blog blog Ahmad, modifying the directory block. Now if I hit escape, it writes it off. I do a directory. 

Oh, I didn't hit escape. 

Okay, well, I blogged budget, budget, Code Code, Ms. Smith. So I, uh, I modified the directory by hand. The police aren't too happy with people knowing what a disk block is. But God said it's our ancestral land and that's, they're just going to have to live with it. I, as a matter of fact, I want people to look at the windows blocks because that's, you don't want ignorant people. That's, that's like, that's evil. That's an evil. Keeping people ignorant in that him doing sting operations on poor. It's like just wolves eating children or something. I don't know. Anyways, so, uh, so, uh, let's see what else we have here. Now we're going to look at, uh, the, uh, the fs segment register. Okay. So, uh, we're turning on the compiler trace and we're entering an expression. You can use this as a calculator. Three plus four, seven. Um, it simplifies the expression. The compiler simplifies constants. And then, uh, if we say, hi, I equals three plus I didn't initialize it, but I'm just showing you what the code is. So this compiles, these are, uh, these are in well, 

64 bit values added to a global variable. We don't have volatile, um, we never use a register. Global variables. Local variables are registered but not global. Anyway. So, uh, uh, so we, I just wanted to show that we have the compiler turned on the compiler trace, we can do a directory, you can see what a directory command is. It pushes some strings. So some of this code gets free diff. It's no longer needed. Um, otherwise if you make a function, it stays around in memory. Um, so, uh, you eventually have to reboot. But that's what we're trying to be a common or a 64. That's not pathetic and it's modern 64 bit. Anyway, so, uh, let's see what else we have here. Uh, now we're going to look at the fs is the uh, fs segment registered. This is a, you probably don't know assembly language, but there's a, um, there are registers, which are little things that, a whole values, and this is kind of a, um, I'm using it like a register. 

It used to be something different, but now it's, it's, it's been kind of a, it, it barely functions and I'm, I made use of it, but most people can't make use of it. So I use it for the, uh, the, uh, current task record. You see this number up here in the corner, seven f d nine, two, two, eight. Um, when I said fs that printed a global variable, it's actually, it's a register. Um, Alex, it's kind of tricky how it actually did this, but anyway, you see that two to eight, you can see it's the same number. So that's, we don't have process ids. We have, uh, we have the address of a task record. Um, so, uh, the rip is a register and the task record, um, we're going to look at the task record here in a second. Um, we're going to turn off tracing and, uh, we're going to do a man page on c task. 

That's just a, um, anyway, c task is a task record. So fs is a pointer to a task record and you have the registers that gets stored when you saved the context. You have the, you have the current directory, current derive and current directory. Um, you have, uh, when you make an exception, it's, that starts nestling the exceptions that, um, it's, it's tied in. The compiler is tied in with the, uh, everything's tied together. These tasks record. Um, there was no separation. It's, it's not really that big. And there's a saying a Stalin said quantity has a quality all its own. And if you keep it small and you can get away with, uh, without, you can get away with a pretty gnarly, this is kind of gnarly. It's kind of lots of different things. It's not that much though. It's pretty small. So, uh, now we're going to dump the memory, the size of the task record fs. 

So this is the task record and, uh, that's a static dump. This is a, this is a static text. Now we're going to, um, we're going to do a document, don't, this is getting into our, uh, if you're familiar with the temple o s um, you have, uh, the dollar sign is a special escaped for a document features. This is a, uh, you can see it lit up and it's changing. This is a dynamic, a widget that um, that's a special thing. Is that called the heck a hex edit widget. It's refreshed 30 times a second one. The screens updated. Um, this task doesn't change that often. Anyway, so, um, now we're going to do a, a class rep, which is uh, uh, deny dynamic. This is using the, uh, all the, all the information and all the tasks on other classes that you compile. 

The member variables are stored in memory and some of these debug routines will, will automatically figure out what kind of class it is and what the member variables are. And this is dynamic. So, uh, you can see these changing off as big scroll around. This is the, um, window coordinates of this task there. Um, on core zero art, your, um, core zero is where everything is done. The only reason the other cores are used as if they're slaves for a, um, for an effort. If you have a job for the slaves to do, then you do it explicitly. Otherwise everything's on core zero. So if you run applications, they're on core zero and then they, they, they create slaves on the other cores. So, um, of course zero is the only, there's one window per task maximum and a one window per task. And, uh, watch this, I'm going to change the window. I just, uh, I live window left. I changed the, um, I, I can, I can change the window position. These are eight by eight grid positions anyway, so, uh, 

mmm. 

So one, one window per task. Um, only core zero can have windows. The other, the other slave tasks don't have windows and applications are core zero anyway. So it's mostly for one application at a time. You can run more than one, but it doesn't have any kind of sharing for disks. So if one hogs the desk, that's it. That's, it's, it's, um, instead of optimizing for a mainframe multiuser we optimize for one user where you only want to play one video game at a time. So we optimize for one video game at a time instead of, um, we tried to keep the code simple and, um, so we, it doesn't do sharing. 

Uh, 

it's pretty sick. It will just, uh, 

it will have poor sharing doesn't play nicely, but it doesn't really crash. That's pretty safe when it comes to a locking down the heaps and devices and stuff. They're all safe. They just don't share. So now we're going to look at, um, we're going to change the current directory, which is a, which is a character pointer in the character pointer in the, uh, in the task record. Then we're going to Maliki it, a fixed buffer. We don't do it like this. Normally, normally we do a variable length and then we're going to copy string copy. Demo Games is a directory or any copy that, so watch this, look at that. We changed the directory, uh, by hand, which is a horrible abuse of power. But that's the power you have with this. It's a matter of fact, uh, if you want to, uh, if you want to access another task, interprocess communication is a joke. It's like there's nothing stopping you. So if you have a home, if I have a variable here, I 64 I and I say address the eye and then I come over here and I'd take this point, her address, and then I come over here and I say, uh, I 64 star j equals zero x. 

So I just said a pointer, no face stays dark. Jay was one, two, three, four, five. And then if I come over here and I say, I, I just changed that variable. It's just a memory location anyway, so I can also, uh, I can also say crosstalk a crosstalk. And if like give the process id, which is a, that's the address of the task record. So zero x seven ft ffd nine a c two eight. I can, I can tell it. Um, this is a, I can put characters into his keyboard buffer. It's kind of a, there used to be a pr, there's a, there's a term for wires are getting crossed anyway. So, um, what I just did is I sent characters to his buffer. Anyway, we're going to do one more thing I think before we're done here. Let's see. Maybe we're done. 

Let's see. Yeah, we're done. Okay, so this is a, the common or 64, one of the major, um, what it was used for, it was playing around and learning and poking and getting in and breaking stuff that your, that was the fun instead of a video game. He just played around with this stuff. And, uh, that's, that's, that's our ancestral land where we were, we have a divine right to this, like the Jews had a right to their homeland. Um, we have a divine right to this low level access. We're supposed to have access to ports and memory and disk blocks and all of that is our divine right as a commodore 64 Americans in our ancestor descending.`,

`so I'm supposed to do an obscene display
of 600 horsepower maximum performance
for our okay so you know our unique
we're gonna like fucking thing we didn't
put on our thinking when entertain mr.
god okay we're gonna be doing here so
like I told somebody zero gravity and
they said great
it's a way to get inspired is to sensory
deprivation no that's not how you do it
because like I tried that doesn't work a
because like what perturbation got a /
to be not goes nah so there's a faggot
what do you think you got wind
resistance mister fucking where they
call them and it depended on what is
with mr. Peggy basically so like I live
on a hill I used to like to ride the
bicycle this is fucked
this is completely fucked it's like you
go at you it's like
it's kind of weird okay because like in
Tempe I totally rode the bikes right and
it was it was flat I didn't realize that
it made that big a difference but this
is a no-go like out the door because
like it's like fucked this disc this
fucking this fucking Hill it doesn't
seem like a big hill but it's like oh my
god I do not want to fucking go up the
hill because it's just fucked so that
kind of puts it and wonder what happens
in like San Francisco and all the other
places sizzling people actually do that
shit my god we go up hills on bicycles
and hills are just fucked just saying so
I think we need mr. God because we're
not here to get inspired
so
this is good lighting captures my
Pacific at the five o'clock shadow or
some shit so uh - lanyard wait so like I
I said there was some they were taking
the dazzle off of my videos I was
tripping out because I could swear they
were like editing my videos - like there
were a certain point there was a point
where I like in my humility video all of
a sudden my face changed and I was
humble I could swear they edited maybe I
was high on drugs I don't know but
anyway all of a sudden like from one day
to the next like is like what I could
swear there was an epic change in
attitude there and like when I threw the
pinecone at the birds the other day they
like it was like edited I could swear
they panned it or some shit you know
sometimes I think it's like angels and
shit controlling the camera and
everything I don't know what better fuck
okay so like chill out because like
there's angels and shit
so it relaxed just fucking like way out
of our control
so like fucking and there's just this
and we got God fuck them up mister gosh
well guess we got to fucking fist to god
fucking so see that or I just got an
angel but anyway so like
I think so we're going to go long form
and not email this to Diana so like okay
there's a grackle you see that that's
the fucking Greco oh I used to have a
grackle shoot anyway grackles
so uh my brother Danny knows the names
of flowers he needs he loves my mom she
said but - and yeah he said the other
one didn't say hey it was not fucking
for two years what the fuck others
anyway he's name is the names of the
flowers but Danny viennese fucking
charming is both too smarter I know I am
of course what's fucked what if he like
knows different shit you know that's the
kind of thing that makes you fucking
freak out it's like are we equal and
you're like knowing some other shit just
like you look at women right it's like
it takes work to make them different
so like holy fuck
in the case of Diana it's like holy fuck
well that's a different situation
completely different the normal
situation is women are kind of like
underachiever asian chick but this is
not even on wait what so like normally
you have to make excuses for women but
uh it's like what the fuck cuz okay so
Scott said it takes work make them
different cakes to like Scott let's make
you cock your head and say hold on what
waits cost because like that's the
interesting point you know you got
angels and shit like wait a sec there's
angels why are they not fucking doing

[Music]
we just went into overdrive
okay I don't know like what are the
ramifications so I go God what the fuck
why are the Angels like just hanging out
and shit
Dante bored God said we likes bored
things would you like bored I guess
after a billion years of fucking doing
the same fucking shit you commit suicide
if you didn't like bored my god whistles
crickets so maybe they're just like
designed for that shit or something
obviously because they commit suicide
obviously they commit suicide if they
couldn't handle boredom because like
bugs you know like you look at any I'd
like to pick Peter dad but he's this
business you know I didn't go to MIT for
like dad rule was let's just say the
smart person I got to associate with and
see like he was a disgusted with
Hollywood but he was always like oh it's
the same movie it's nothing original so
that kind of clued me into oh my god
angels must be going bonkers and shit
God must be no mockers but I think
they're really they must really like
anyway once you see the richness of
creation
you know it's weird sometimes you like
level up and then you like you think
you're above like you think you're above
people and any like oh my god I could
swear I just leveled up how come I'm not
above people what the fuck man

a couple times with the fuck's going on
then once in a while I get a brief
glimpse of oh my god the slums holy fuck

know one pill makes you bigger one pill
makes you small um so like I don't know
it's like anyway so uh you can be on a
higher level and shit so it's like oh my

bored they're like fucking a couple
fucking five levels above us and shit

sometimes I what did you do it in here
huh oh yeah see that's what I'm talking
about okay let's do it
no no no what are we doing here what the
fuck enter enter what's looking at
listen hey do you know the route cart
yeah like these are new to me
payment approved he's from newkirk ok so
like Diana thinks I'm I want used to
work Oh
thank you okay so you can totally run
and nobody cares
it's disturbing the peace so let's see a
niggers paranormal shit you got the
fucking CA you see that shit man
I get the nigger fucking setting off the
alarm shit that's fucking what the fuck
with me all the time
where's my car fucking car got - oh
there's my car I don't even what my car
looks like so like wait you see that
shit man looking
deston fucking paranormal shit man of
course the fucking alarm goes off with
me huh didn't go off with me nigger he's
working here
Terry you gangster
wow that actually uh wasn't too high for
the grocery store okay not too shabby
like sometimes get lost in there like
one goons are you like I'm extra
cautious except for them they like you
it's like
there's a motion I have grace I should
try and do that that's like do it the
right way
not the fucking lazy you know I'm saying
like Terry why don't you fucking drive
like a fucking white man and fucking
don't
just fuckin drive like a fucking fucking
want you fucking drive from here to
there in the minimum distance and don't
fucking be drive like oh damn it fucking
stop saying that shit okay hard care be
okay there's a median go go go go go
they're fucking paranormal shit okay oh
fuck fuck fuck fuck you fuck your
fucking person fucking plan this shit
man
fucking paranormal shit now that's
fucked up you see that shit fucked it up
it's fucking crossroad shit man you
fucking missed your chance and then it's
fucking and then you end up in another
parallel universe and you didn't have
that chance because he fucked up and B
you died because the man salaat killed
you because he has the grace now we got
a choice of either go straight or we can
go to the right I think we go straight
because better man wins and you got the
crossroad shit I'm saying okay I fucked
this up sometimes they like have a merge
and like suddenly you get a delay and
then it's like back to the mainstream
you know I had that happen okay so like
crossroads right go no go and then
depending on what you did get an outcome
no the weird thing is there's a there's
a video game called dragon's lair and
it's actually as a matter of fact it's
actual fucking video discs
it's fucking very ironic very ironic
it's it's dragon's lair it's like
Knights and armor and the fucker is
playing video disk segments it's playing
segments of video
fucking that is totally fucking ironic
just fuck because that's how I picture
it okay when you're a knight depending
on what decision you make at the
crossroad
that's totally fucking how it works get
the grace which seems wrong you will do
what I say when I say back to the front
let's try that again
you will do what I say when I say back
to the front you coward you serve it you
blind man back to the fruit dad okay
like if you do your voice right you can
be a monk and like your voice doesn't
crack because he you don't crack your
voice because you know just how much she
go you should play it drops out on other
drums to that
well if what I say you will die what I
say you must die back to the front
parking of machine-gun fire he used to
it somehow what
it's better than just being boring come
on it's better than being boring like
Steve Mustaine there every fucking is
from Megadeth was doing a tribute to
Chris Cornell he totally fucked it up
let's go did man do it that was awful
they did like that they did like he did
he did out shine he did outside right he
did like it they he just they played
like the it was like shortened they did
it on really short notice and they only
did like the first part of the song I
mean it sounded recognizable and
everything but he totally they totally
did a shitty ass job and what that was
that was somebody holding a mirror okay
we got a green light don't fucking trip
out okay
this is fucking not suicide suicide l
hear they got get head on what the left
turns like coolly like go suicidal sit
there okay the left turns go totally
suicide
it's like CIA put like crazy not suicide
chicken you gotta play chicken when you
just it's like it's totally like every
time you go in there's fuckin playing a
game of chicken with the oncoming left
if somebody else is making all that turn
oh look the critical thing here is you
gotta stick your head out the window
oh there's people there see I'm really
good at this it took like a year to get
rid of this just fucking crazy look
whose neck it's funny so
until we have to I'm not gonna stop you
have to fucking do it
just what do you call that one the other
I'm back
what do you call that one like the knife
is hot no that's not what you when the
knife is hot okay so you can hang out
right there I think this is trash for
any reason this is not trash no this is
fucking trash does it sorta traction I
think it's fucking trash my parents are
gonna fucking enough dude okay
distraction wait a minute
nobody need some music no no no please
anyone get copyright fuck can't dvz work
has to have music when you're doing
nigger work the the Union the Union
drywall people could not`,

`so entertaining that and your ass will
follow this so physics girl physics girl
says happy physically tear says he
starts to show entertain God in your
asshole father so I like the heat to hot
day
so uh
it was 122 in Phoenix in 1991 think
anyway it was like the year after I had
I did this I did drywall a couple
summers taping drywall anyway yeah I
could swear I worked the hottest day but
I checked it apparently I didn't but
anyway that be fuckin cool man
that's like the coolest thing to brag
about right so like how do you measure
the value of life the coolest fucking
thing being able to brag you worked the
122 day in Phoenix but I didn't deep and
drive all construction work so how would
you put that on the quality of life I
so god bless his youth he gives you shit
like that how do you put a price on that
you know these guys perfectly just so
entertain God in your ass will follow
so as pool fighter dude was a
dr. smack yet enough
beep ladies
you know they measure ego and pìkô
dijkstra Deeks just like computer
science person I guess like Knuth but I
they measured ego and Pico Dijkstra
anyway mr. e 5l Pico Dijkstra how many
pick your district and I think mr. mr.
growl mr. growl is clocking in at some
pretty heavy
Pickard extra pickle distress
so scarce mr. Carey is going to be
crushed
choose your attitude he adjusted his
heart is full he what Jeff few walks
wisely will be delivered this may shock
you but I believe the single most
significant decision I can make on a
day-to-day basis my dress bad dude
more important in my past my education
my bankroll my success or failure Famer
pain what other people think me or say
about me my circumstances my position
attitude keeps me going and cripples my
progress it alone fuels my fire or
assaults my my hoax
when my attitudes are right there is no
barrier too high no valley too deep no
dream too extreme no challenge too great
for me yet we must admit we spend more
of our time concentrating and fretting
over things cannot be changed in life
than we do giving attention to one thing
they can choice bad dude fucking Jesus
that's fucking sucks fucking rocks are
fucking hot looking yeah nothing like
this macho feel it of Sun glinted Sun
glinted steering wheel metal
that'll make you feel like a real man
simply`,

`so I smoked a cigarette started walking
back
I got a soda for a buck at the the food
stand the guy was a little disappointed
I didn't buy a burger they're really
good actually they got really good Greek
food and stuff for some reason I think
it's expensive but it's not really
expensive
Karen anyway I have a half the subway I
think well I was at some Jewish person
kind of expressed contempt for Subway I
don't know what your standards are so if
the street food might be a little bit uh
I don't know well Subway's a little bit
more I don't know it's a kind of a grimy
uh I don't know I don't know if that
bothers you if Subway's our problem I
don't know what you're going to think
about the street food but the street
food is actually gourmet some gourmet
Kiros and stuff like that I used to love
those that's like it's a great guy I
think it's great mate I don't know if he
has Greek that's pretty cool so uh
[Music]
I got a footlong earlier missus the
other half
so
so dollar for ganna soda I guess is
pretty good so like now I'm buying sugar
instead of diet
so if you're starving calories are
actually important
Diana if you're fat and this is going to
be just gonna fix that real quick this
will fix the fat does he get it walk I
walk all over over over over so 10
blocks this way to get to the library
and then about Burnside is about maybe
about six blocks that way that's a main
location that's where the that's where
some of the soup kitchens are that's
where a gas station is that it's open
all night
most of shit closes down at night that
gas station is open so that's a that's a
night is a really long time the Dagobah
goes by really fast because you're on
the computer all day night takes forever
so mostly like you're it seems like it's
mostly night on the streets alone
anyway not good anyway I get the gun
flipped me the bird
I guess it's not true whatever anyway so
that gas station is important it's open
24 hours and then so that so you got a
let's just say you got a let's say get
the library Street here and then you got
like a couple blocks over is the bridge
where we sleep and then about six blocks
over is the the gas station Street
Burnside there's a Burnside Bridge and
then another maybe six blocks is the
Greyhound station that's where there's a
bathroom and a lot of places to sleep
and TP is over there that's where you
get showers and laundry so if you wanted
to take a shower every day we can do
that the only problem is that you got to
wait for you probably have to wait
several couple hours but if the shower
is worth it to you we got there's no
reason not to I just don't like to I'm
kind of lazy if you wanted to take a
shower everyday we could do that but
because we got time to kill the library
opens at 10:00 so if you wanted to wait
from well actually you can sleep over
there right in line and take your shower
pretty quick but uh so if you want to
take shower every day we can do that -
I'm just a little bit too lazy
mmm
the irony is I'm not really doing
anything except waiting but I just don't
like to wait in line over there
so
they got about our
we were
[Music]
yeah that DPI place could be a little
hardcore I think you can get there in
the morning it's clean this is pretty
nasty when I got there it was like blood
on the toilet seat I've never seen that
before
does nasty look what do you do you know
somebody said it's like prison as it
on the one hand uh you know in terms of
you can be a smart academic person you
can be a good business person you can be
a good warrior you can be a tough guy
survivor and each of these things are
levels of degree to aspire to you know
like I think it's achievable
you know I mean think of all the Jews in
history that had to migrate and shit
people in history you know and to be a
to be to be delicate and fragile that's
not good you know so that's not a virtue
some people think it is yeah well I'm
rich without I'm rich with high
standards I don't I'd rather be that's
not really that seems like a poorly
constructed robot you know like if you
made a robot you want to be robust right
you want to goddamn robust robot that
fucking survives damaged and survives
all the elements not some pansy-ass
fancy-pants robot so like in terms of so
a person who can survive seems like a
better that's a little bit overrated I
don't know if I'm being a little bit
crazy but uh
[Music]
[Music]
it's pretty safe I already told you
I'm pretty much under the eye of the CIA
on some level I don't know who the fuck
it is but nothing's gonna happen it's
enough watched
how does odd death how death the city
sit solitary that was full of people how
she become as a widow that she was great
among nations and prince/princess among
the provinces how she become tributary
she weep it's sore in the night when her
tears are tears around her cheeks among
all their lovers she had none to comfort
her all their friends have dealt
treacherously whether they're become our
enemies Judah is going to be captivity
because of affliction because of great
servitude she dwelleth the one who
heathen she find no rest she find
[Music]
yeah if you make slaves than it makes
you have to be asleep anyway she finds
no rest all their persecutors overtook
her between the straights though the
ways of Zion do mourn because none come
to the solemn feast all our gates are
desolate her priest sigh her virgins are
afflicted and she is in bitterness your
adversaries are the chief her enemies
prosper for the LORD hath afflicted her
for the multitude of her transgression
her children are gone in captivity
before the enemy and from the daughter
of Zion all their beauty is departed her
princes are become like parts that find
no passenger and they are gone without
his strength before the pursuer`,

`okay
so I'm gonna do some sim structure
basically I learned how to make PID
controllers we'll talk about what a PID
controller is so this program I wrote
back in 2000 and it was pretty cool at
the time so I wrote this program mm what
do you want to make how about a nuclear
submarine
well anyway
so you can you can make a submarine a
kid made a submarine I had some some
people sent me scenarios that they had
created we can only get a couple these
were sent in but somebody made a this is
pretty cool so somebody made this I
think you press 1 & 2
[Music]
let's start over then you break them and
then you separate a stage I think you
have to try and land
you're supposed to land it so anyway
somebody made this with sim structure
which is the program that I wrote
submarine some how old is this person
age 13 nathan age 13 made this let's
zoom in oh it has a torpedo
oh it has okay so you can inflate the
submarine so I made this program back in
now it flows up somebody sent in the
model of the solar system my numeric
integrator is probably pretty impressive
it can do the solar system so if you
zoom in he did the earth I'm gonna track
oh sure
what did I do oh shit don't do that
yeah I'm going to track that earth okay
so now we zoom in moon is spinning
around the earth so X it's actually
if you tried to set up a solar system it
takes a long time for them to settle
into an orbit something like that it's
not easy doing it like if you just make
a mass and we can give it a vector
velocity vector oops I thought I pleased
to do mass let's get out of here for
this anyway I'm hurry
also they mean that charge particles
you you make the charge attractor or
repelled you have to repel so the the
the color represents the charge they
made a video game where you have to
repel I'm pressing keys by the way in
order to make these programs do stuff so
someone who made a rocket surfer so we
can do it you wanted to a control system
on this puppy
so this some kid some kid made this with
sim structure
I'm not sure I like the what he does
with his hands is pretty funny okay so
you want let's make a controller for
this puppy so Phillip so T one touch
thrust equals let's say T 1 dot
saturation times
oh let's uh what we want is if he falls
over if he falls backward that means cut
the throttle if he falls back cut the
throttle if he doesn't fall back
increase the throttle so uh put labels
what is what is this bond shit
let's say bond 18
so our angle is going to be fund 18
heading I made the mistake of doing this
in degrees just that
I took wrap and unwrapped is supposed to
unwind a an angle and place it in a
certain anyway
let's do Engel okay so let's display the
angle first of all okay so
hey holy shit
okay so the angle is 25 15 14 so zero is
all the way back so we want 90 okay so
so the angle I think we want to take -
pi / - why is it positive both
directions am being an idiot okay so
it's between okay so
oh we want to multiply this with you
let's take five times the Engel
okay that's
okay so we made a controller for
faceplant so somebody made a hoverboard
you want to turn this into a hoverboard
you know what do if you're if you're
doing it by yourself you can fly what
I'm gonna do it manually so watch this
so this thing will fly if you do it
right but we have to make
how about we make a controller what is
the time
t equals four is when it launches so
yeah T less than four else I'm gonna do
a separate controller for time after
four let's do angle one this will be
easy so we just do two angles angle one
is for one word and we want this to be
let's see what happens
so Engel to
let's let's - let's subtract so this is
uh let's let's go 45 degrees how about
that
so we're not doing PID controllers yet
we could do PID
we want it the other direction
what I meant to say is we want what I
see
what the hell am i doing we're going
around the zero point
there we go I did it
[Applause]
this
let's put a grid okay
so I made a hoverboard if you want to
make him fly at a certain elevation this
is a y equals five how about let's let's
put it at y equals ten what is the
particle for his head P 6 P 6 equals 20
or 15 how about P 6 equals 15 plus 15
minus P 6 del Y now we can we can give a
coefficient for this
let's say 20
okay if he ever starts bending forward
we don't we don't want him to bend
forward so we're gonna increase that
okay more we want more of the first less
of the second
okay
lesson two second
okay let's reduce his elevation see if
we can stay at ten
these are increments of five I do
believe so peace sakes is that kid
do you want to try for a more exact how
about if
how about if
10 - p6 doubt why absolute value
let's increase this to five
[Music]
yeah hello yeah it is who's this
Secret Service okay no we're gonna do
we're going to take this put it here
little we aren't going to how about we
want / this how about 10 divided by 1 +`,

`hi I'm Terry Davis I'm the smartest
programmer that's ever lived I was
chosen by God to make his temple and I
was given divine intellect so on let's
say you have an integer I and you say I
equals one two three four
there we can see one two three four in
the hexadecimal 4d2 now if we stay I
equals eight there you can see its ASCII
4165 okay in temple OS my compiler will
put together multiple characters in a
character constant we don't do unicode
we do ASCII 8-bit ASCII not seven bit
seven bit signed ASCII is retarded
anyway so we do 8-bit ASCII 7-bit ascii
signed ascii is retarded anyway so uh
now there was a nigger who came up with
this idea well that's pretty nigger
licious the way we do it is we just say
hello and we use and we use this goes to
standard out and we use the printf so
the way we do it so to print see out so
we make a statement like this
I hit f5 there we go hello hello hello
okay so uh if we do you can imagine what
do you think this is going to do okay so
ABCD let's unassembled this and here we
have we have here here's an ASCII a what
they called a put char then we have a
string where they call to print we have
a put char print put char print okay so
as a matter of fact we can have up to
eight characters in a in a character
character constant so as a matter of
fact we can we can get this done with
I'm just going to look look at that
pretty nice huh so let's let's make sure
it runs right there we got ABCD at the
bottom right see the ABCD okay so um so
you can see we we don't have to have the
name main we can say demo then move and
we can do demo
you do demo several times we can do do
this okay so I'm the smartest
programmers ever lived anyway so what if
we have I'm going to show you so the
most important thing in programming is
naming so let's call this that's kind of
ironic you caught me off guard
switch demo how about that okay so the
most important thing in programming is
naming the most powerful statement in
the C language is the switch statement
this is the most powerful the best the
best statement in the C language is the
switch statement that is the most
powerful statement I don't this is kind
of a okay so I'm gonna we're doing hey
maybe you want me to to make this well
anyway I hope you'll forgive okay why
don't I do this correctly
well I okay so I'm doing an
example that is
not not the best way to program
obviously okay so uh so let's do this
simply print one tonight and what
happens if we do 20 let's see what
happens if we do 20 we get one through
nine zero through nine okay so uh how
does this work a lot of people the CIA
wants you to think it's nothing more
than if-then l if-then-else the CIA
wants you to think it's the same as if
else it's not the way a switch statement
works is there's a there's a lookup
table in it what it does is it it looks
up in the table and then it jumps ahead
to some code to a segment of code and
then the code jumps to the bottom to a
common location to continue here we are
we're calling to put chars and so forth
now notice here do you know why we have
this compared to ten why is this
comparison to ten here okay so the first
comparison I RSI is the local register
variable now why is this comparison to
ten here do you know why that's because
the switch only has ten a range of 10
now what if what if we what if we were
only doing up to 10 we wouldn't really
need 2 compared to 10 would we
but in there's no way to signal in
normalcy there's no way to tell the
compiler that you're not going to
violate that so you know you know what
Holy See has okay look at this
so this this the code size is BiBi okay
the code size is BB Holy See has a has a
syntax for a switch statement that's
that doesn't include the arm the range
check the switch statement without the
rain check
now the code side is Assizes b1 and it
no longer has the comparison to ten of
so um that's why I'm the smartest
programmer that's ever lived now
furthermore I came up with a so a lot of
the improvements to a language or kind
of junk but I came up with some genuine
improvements that if you can improve the
C language that that shows you're a
genius
who's smarter than every programmer
that's ever come B I am smarter than
every programmer before me I am smarter
than every programmer before me do you
wanna know why I'm smarter than every
programmer before me because I have
improved the C syntax in a way that is
not nigger licious any nigger can make
some nigger feature but I've improved it
in a way that's not nigger licious okay
any nigger can make it nigger licious
I'm the smartest programmer to ever
lived look at that you see how we got
those now how is this coded okay so the
it's pretty clear that it doesn't jump
when it hits a break and it just jumps
down to the comment now I had to do
something I'm ashamed of I had to put a
call to some tor subroutine that I stuck
right here I'm kind of ashamed of that
and as a matter of fact God just
questioned my judgment he said Terry are
you worthy to be the man who makes the
temple if you are you must answer is
this nigger licious or is this divine
intellect and that's the question
I'll leave I'll leave you with that you
know Google they asked you interview
questions well the kind of question I
face on the job is is this nigger
licious is this too much boo doo for our
purposes for our our mission statement
our mission is to be a modern Commodore
64 is this too much voodoo that this is
the OP this there is this is voodoo the
question is
is this too much and that's this is the
hardest question you could ever face in
programming this right here is the
hardest question right here right here
is the hardest question in programming
is this too much food ooh for the next
ten centuries as for God's official
temple holy holy see this is the hardest
question in programming right here okay
there it is hardest question in
programming`,

`up for quite a number of years I have
had confusion on my exact reality an
example of the of okay The Truman Show
reflects an example of a of a strange
reality you know he's like you know he's
like gradually he picks up that
something's not quite right about my
life you know I'm saying my reality is
just not quite right then it eventually
he discovers his in a little bubble on
in his on TV so Terry me there's just
something not right about my reality and
I don't have any I don't have any you
know maybe one day he came up with the
conception hey what if I'm like in a
bubble and there's cameras and he had
this conception that explained his
reality what I need is some concept of
what my reality is you know what I mean
for the Truman Show guy his answer was
he's on a TV show and they're taking
cameras of him for Terry I have zero
conception of what my reality is I don't
know the simplest thing is I'm a person
is on disability and I drive around in
my car you know i buy food and I sleep
in a campground and once in a while I
talked to a person in a store I asked
them for you know I buy a make a
purchase of soda or something buy some
cigarettes
but then it starts getting strange like
like oh why does the radio seem to talk
to me like when I say stuff here didn't
rate when I talk to myself the radio
seems to respond now it perhaps I have
to explain that when it responds it's
sort of liking a sort of a code now I so
what do I mean by that when they say one
thing I interpreted as though they're
speaking in code speaking something else
and that something else is a response to
where I just said so I that's kind of
the simplest thing and then you started
getting like the YouTube videos or
popping up based on what I say here like
in the YouTube feed box okay and you
know the internet sites I go to are
supposed to be somewhat comprehensive
and yet they look like a very very tiny
world and when I walk the streets I get
a very vague sense that I'm not just
some stranger you know I get a very
vague sense that I'm somebody yeah that
they're interacting with you know like
for example a reality TV star or
something they I get a big sense maybe
that's where I am maybe I'm imagining it
so basically
it goes on and on and on my whole
reality is very confusing I I'm really
so I don't really have a choice you know
sometimes I think that uh as you mature
you just you know the speak of heaven as
a cloud you know you know if you can
imagine walking around on some crazy
like you look down and like this fog but
somehow you're walking around maybe
that's reasonable I know that was pretty
weird so uh there's always the desire to
make it real you know but you know after
20 years it doesn't seem to get real and
the whole time there's been a a verge of
making it big for the past 20 years
I've been like oh great now I'm finally
they're finally understanding it I have
a space alien the whole world or no so
yeah I'm really
let's just say I'm walking in the air
and I am and somehow I'm floating in a
way up in the air and I have no idea
what's under me I mean just just imagine
you're just like walking around up in
like the sky or some crazy shit say why
am i walking around in the sky how come
on I'm not falling you're like what the
fuck is going on your arms just sail
it's kind of like this is completely
fucked you know saying imagine you're
like walking around somehow you're like
walking and it's the goddamn sky
and like your feet are just not falling
and like you're just like you kind of
learned how to live life up here like oh
that's weird
yes there's where I get my food I don't
know some Jetsons
that's getting a little carried away but
I think well this is very strange I have
no no understanding you know I used to
need an understanding it it wasn't
normal for a person to be way up in the
sky like when I was a kid but this is
weird because this is like normal now
and I really I really don't have any so
if you had any idea how a confused I was
and yet how I just carry on you know
fuck it I guess yeah you used to be an
absolutely batshit crazy
you just live you know you're kind of
like oh well that's that's unusual a
stranger in a strange land or some shit
well I guess this is the way you do to
moonwalk like floating in the air or
some shit well I'm just gonna go over to
that fucking freak freak freak tree and
get my fruit because I figure that's out
this reality is sort of familiar but
it's really fucking completely blows my
mind like I can sort of like maybe I can
weave my hands and for some reason it
makes me say shoot up or some shit I
don't know but you kind of figure this
shit out and it's like I have no fucking
clue I just did that yeah you have no
clue what's going on and I'm just
absolutely just mind be completely
distraught blown you know and somehow I
kind of like just just
with it you know James stay happy you
know maybe I it's kind of like yelling
at a wall for a long time and like a dog
barking at the my head whiteout fucks to
do that you know what I fucking to yell
at the thin air you know as a crazy see
the crazy people on the street they're
yelling at nothing and they must be
perceiving an answer and it's all very
kind of fucked`,

`so here we are on our walk my ears
plugged up get these strange little my
skin is gouged in a couple spots
I dont know if you can see it
look at that
not really you ever wake up drunk and
wonder what the fuck happened
I think I had some some fingernail um my
fingernail had atiny flap that I
removed it and it created a sharp so my
fingernail is really sharp then I think
eye gouge myself on my face and on that
other hand pretty weird
we don't have bugs and stuff like that
here and Vegas no mosquitoes none of
that so it's kind of obvi obviously it's
no big deal so I just had a strange
what the fuck is that
you're not afraid are you Terry no
fucking sounds like you it's like you
got an ear plug and there's the sound of
a dragon either that or it's a far away
minibike probably a dragon
boy I'm really tripping out seeing shit
wait I'm just like shadows looks like
little objects and stuff there's a
black cat that was at our house 
there could be snakes just thinking
what do i do if i see a rattlesnake
that would be bad
how would you like to be lewis and clark
those are bad guys huh what no
so lif was just getting too boring 
what i dont know grand adventure
thats a very strange noise
what the fuck is that noise 
its like bats or something
holy fuck this is like battle
its like a battle i think
better course not be quite so brave
what what the fuck just happened
its a battle very strange situation 
were not in kansas anymore
well
gunfire
thats serious gunfire jesus 
well lets hope i dont get zapped
so if my head explodes
you'll know what happened
fuck if i know
oh well you know
you know I do magic all the time
I know about other dimensions wait so
there's a big battle going on 
you think i should go help
bang bang bang hey i got you with my finger gun
a very strange thing to happen
good thing i have my buddy on the camera
onward to victory I claim this land for god
almighty what get the fuck out
fucking spirits or whatever I don't know you
you think they're friends or foes
I know it's just some time travel shit
other dimensions forever discontented
people are be on your guard against
every form agreed for even when one has
an abundance that's his life abundance
does this life consists of his
possessions let's take a brief look you
agreed practically speaking reading it
inordinate desire for more it's an
excessive unsatisfied hunger to possess
like an untamed beast greed grasp
clutches reaches claws clings stubbornly
refusing to surrender the word enough is
not in the beasts vocabulary kin to envy
and jealousy greed 
that's gunfire
I'm going this way
lets go to the battle
shooting at me 
well if i get pinged you know what happend 
zap gloriously my head explodes 
wait you know I got the
infinite improbability ring of
protection miss my head explodes
i dont know 
come on i got mr. God
crazy shit
who needs who needs just internet and
movies when you got fucking
cross-dimensional battle to have fun
with we're gonna make a quick escape hey what
if our side loses there's gotta be one
side that's our side right you think I
should go back help our side
i dont know how do i help our side
in the general am I the general no
I'm just I dont know what the fuck I am
great You Know Who I am
cross-dimensional warfare
I dont know
that's peculiar
so there's a battle
Transformers what do you think
we talked about a vaccine I think they
just made me a little bit braver warrior
it's not every day you wake up discover
a fourth-dimensional battle right up
your street
okay sergeant potato head grunt get back
to the front
this is sergeant potato head you will do
i dont know what
back to the front grunt
so let's go over what we know so like
did I wake up after passing out I think
I did so I got an ash gonna in this get
a little divot flesh removed somebody
talked about vaccinations
so
I think you're still taking potshots at
me what you know you walked by with the
sticks pretty well scared of me remember
me did you remember me doing this it
sticks I did a March
i dont know what the fuck it was 
maybe that was a that was a big pit
where they have the obelisk
back there in that pit your fourth
dimensional bullets cannot touch me
piece of shit cause like I'm in the third
dimension so there I'm gonna waggle my
tail
get down the fuck back home away from
your fourth dimensional fucking what are
you doing it to fuck out of here you
fourth dimension what if I'm neutral
okay I am Switzerland I am Here I am
here to oversee this fourth dimensional
battle and hopefully nobody shoots at me
wait bang okay 
I am Switzerland is it Swiss or Switzer what is
oh yeah 
well something life gets boring God
sends entertainment from the fourth
dimension because it's not tolerable for
sparrows to not have food when the
sparrows need food mister God sends the
entertainment it was a black cat weren't
lets see if we can what should we do if we see the
black cat i dont know so
we're not afraid of black cats now this
is the spot where the fourth-dimensional
fuckers first came wait oh it's the
lights you fourth-dimensional fuckers
find out what that light is new
i dont know just dont feel like going into the
light
screaming tires what
so now that were back
from the mouth of hell 
i have i have been to the mouth of hell
God is all in all the king's heart
it's like channels of water you in the
hands of the Lord turns it where every
wishes God rules God reigns God and God
alone his way is right at least his
glory deep within the hearts of men and
women most would never acknowledge it is
a realization that we don't have the
final answer there's this hidden clause
tucked away in the deep recesses
I was thinking minds it says there may
be a God after all let me take this to
the ultimate future for Humanity
god is sovereignty in
charge one second after they died the
men and women who have rejected and
resisted the Lord for years
step into eternity one second that would
be totally at a loss to determine their
future God's sovereignty steps over
their lives and sets for this degree God
may be all`,

`you know what I want to do I want to do
something fun for me
okay so this is fun
let's see what a kid with the toy box
I'd never used this actually I did use
it once by Thomas I tried to bias a
transistor no mother fucker wouldn't
work I could swear the fucking simulator
was broken so let's have some fun
let's take a 741
Oh
let's kind of make an oscillator what do
you say let's make an oscillator how
about one kilohertz let's make a one
kilohertz oscillator okay folks how can
we make a one kilohertz oscillator we
want positive feedback and we want it to
be one kilohertz how hard can it be
who can you do it with a single stage I
think you need about you can get up I
think you can get about factor up you
can get what do you call it well factor
of 10 with each stage so how would we
now we can just if you just throw a
resistor and capacitor into the circuit
that's probably what it's going to be
how hard can it be
what if I just take a resistor and
capacitor okay let's get it let's get a
unity amplifier to begin with let's just
get started here so how do we do that
you want negative feedback what you do
is you look at the circuit diagram for
okay
repeat okay rotate motherfucker I told
you rotate
let's okay
and you rotate huh stupid thing
okay ah I think we just do this don't we
we just connect that to ground connect
that down so
oh I know okay I remember okay
so put this puppy over here what are you
doing
Oh date when you rotate the fucker
vertically
split horizontally rotate why is it here
now okay
so put this Booker and another one of
these footers hey what Shabbat okay
there we go we will start with the unity
came up man
no it's good
I think we want about 10k for the
resistors why are we if we're doing
signal level well after doing opposite
you can get power op amps it's been 10
year it's been 20 years since I I don't
know I used some I don't know how big of
a power amplifier you can get aa pin but
they're more or less
where's the fucking wire like wire
motherfucker come on with lossless
transmission is of course we want loss
that's right kidding me with a fuck dumb
fuck and just one fucking wire I don't
want that
fucking drink okay let's see
passive bitch hey let's make gaya
let's make gay uh hey uh let's make a
voltage step up oh that would be cool
would that be cool that would be cool
we'll chop a this okay let's make a
first Oh will you make an oscillator
yeah then we can like run it through a
turn into square wave and drive some
transistors and make a voltage step up
or something how the fuck do we make a
fucking wire gotta be shitting me maybe
you have to buy that pay money if you
want wires you have to pay money
you got any ideas fuck sign oh yeah I
need to sign in we win okay I think I
did this before no locking I didn't get
very far either how did you know I tried
to make it I tried to make I didn't get
very far
this is embarrassing what the fuck
hey I got wires how did they get wires I
was trying to do it from memory
if you don't look at that cuz it's awful
okay so how did I get wires
diana likes inductors so we're going to
do some inductors this to you okay so
part
okay
so passive we put I don't worry let's
put another one
I'm capable of fuck roti I would out
with them now you tell me okay so
generic parts okay why don't we let's do
let's do this fucker realistic let's do
that let's delete it
Oh
can't I pick a 741
okay hello you know it's Terry yes Terry
Andrew yeah is Terry not today I'll try
and find him
okay bye
oh how about that oh okay here we go
we're cooking with gas
okay we want to ground it okay fire
George
okay I just one round and I please have
ground hooker here you got hey yeah we
want one of those
no that's really do it okay so plus no
no no Oh what am I talking about
it's AC it doesn't have a fucking plus
okay so
what are you doing idiot cut that fucker
there we go okay
that looks better okay let's properties
do you see let's make this fucker wait
no not DC what are you doing DC we don't
want DC okay this is a we're doing a
unity gain amplifier
I won boat sounds good these we would
okay we want diana likes inductors so
you know our unity let's put a square
wave we put a square wave Union fucker
okay wooden killer beautiful
okay and let's connect them for good
Wow where is the fucking ground fucker
maybe it's it
[Music]
where is the fucking ground there oh
okay that makes it
so interpretive dance they create you on
who says you don't do interpretive dance
and fucking interpretive dances off okay
and let's go ahead and connect up a
testing no I want an oscilloscope a come
on oscilloscope one oscilloscope fuck
you
are you shitting me I want to fucking
oscilloscope
how about if I just run it
please see buyers reading talking about
transient response oh no we don't this
is too easy
you project simulation it's supposed to
be unity game you bribed 8k I'm not
having fun are we having fun over not
having fun okay well I've done this all
when I was young and this was new I
would have fun but now this is not fun
frequency to point what are you talking
about 2.5 kilohertz where the fuck did
that come from
I gave you one killers the number one
rule of AC analysis is if you put in one
Gillard's
you get out one Gillard's okay that's
pretty funny okay what the fuck believe
me there is no component that changes
the frequency except that voltage tanker
up the clock divider what do you call it
but the number line flip-flop there
there's no magic frequency changer they
don't make that kind of component the
fuck is this shit
frequency changer that would be cool
maybe it's not grounded or something or
you think
okay I want okay we got networks okay
so they're numbered okay so let's take a
look at what network we got here it is
network number one set net name be out
and we sit let me feed okay now let's
look at ABC analysis okay let's run the
fucker
he's yours mine start frequency stop
frequency would he talk oh is this a
sweep are you kidding me
the fuck what what are we looking at
here the fuck is this oh this is for
bode plot ah
but I already told you the source with
the focuses you seen up yet we just want
these enable simulations transient let's
see well that will certainly accomplish
it the foot
again no no no now fuck you
this is what happened the last time I
use this program nothing happened
this is a fucking
I didn't set a DC voltage the fuck is
that I told you
I fucking told you what I want the fuck
were you doing I think you have to pay
money
see oh that looks better now
run run niggers what does the KKK
motorcycle sound like Brenda you're new
you're ending
fuck this
focusing put fuck you very much
what what is your fucking problem
hey see now no I don't want to fucking
bode plot the fuck is this
I have a fucking voltage source what is
the fucking source you're talking about
a sweep now I have a fucking voltage
source what are you talking about a
passive network or something what the
fuck
well thanks for that
that this is a fucking voltage source
is there a port in no well if you told
me the input then maybe we can do the
motherfucker sources are we having fun
no we're not having fun
fuck this
see
you
you
so check this out so there's a there's a
few different types of oscillators and
whoo
whatever so I just wanted to see
so anyway off we don't want to do that
let's make a uh let's make a voltage
let's make a charging circuit for uh
okay so
you know what I want to do let's make a
so watch what we do
is this going to
I want to square wave why don't you give
me a square wave you motherfucker
frequency modulation what I want a
fucking square wave
you
oh we do want we do want offset of one
I'm going to make a chopper circuit to
uh get some voltage I've never done this
yeah I have okay so we take
do you know what you're doing now I
don't know what I'm doing
how about a Darlington switch we want a
switching transistor wasp it may be is
that what we want
I want to darling come on a tip 120 how
about that you got one of those it could
be this shouldn't be too hard I'm a
little bit scared of MOSFETs just
because
in jail
so I wonder if this simulates parts
getting fried that would be pretty funny
I don't think this simulates parts
getting fried okay so what we want to do
is chop an inductor and
okay so
[Music]
let's see if we can make this fucker
explode there okay this ought to be cool
No
I only put a diode across inductors but
we want the fucker to explode
okay so we are going to chop it and it
wants to keep glowing and so what's
going to happen it's going to explode
there let's see what it does you would
not want to build this circuit
okay let's put it let's put it
I don't know what's going to happen deal
with one cattle in this case
let's make that bigger
okay
you
okay now if we crank it up to a hundred
let's jeez this foot ten
and
well are you kidding me what is your
problem now let's see how much in what
is happening here
we are turning on oh we have a seven oh
it's we have to over turn the transistor
on at one we want it at point 6 volts it
turns on why do we have
is this an inverter one is
that's not where we want the output Oh
use your head
okay let's see here okay so when that
turns off its going to don't we want it
to uh it's going to go through this
shouldn't there be a big spike on this
fucker
what okay it's gonna flow through there
and then when it turns off it's going to
flow through there so that should
actually become a negative voltage or
yeah is that that make sense
something like that let's just crank
that fucker up I think if we make this
I'm pretty sure we get higher voltage
that's great definitely one mill ahead
and that's pretty big isn't it
oh look at that we got 12 volts we
started okay what is ours
what is our vote that what is our supply
voltage this is 1 volt Hey look at that
we got we got a missus ridiculous this
is the difference between an engineer
who has experience and an engineer who
doesn't
[Laughter]
okay oh shit I thought we're gonna get a
higher spike what if we give it more
time to get some current is it
saturating how much current is when we
throw the switch
Vega we're not throwing the switch fast
enough for one thing what if we what if
we turn this into a square wave would
that help I think it would help how hard
can that be why don't you have a fucking
square wave okay fuck
book
so is it
is the current is it saturating bullshit
okay well we got it we got it
it's silly
we got your 50 bolts okay and that's how
you get hand
yeah that was fun okay we had some
success
save copper`,

`so I'm kind of irresponsible an adult is
supposed to you're supposed to act on a
higher level then your Shepherds are
supposed to be above the sheep okay
here's the deal you remember I said if
you if you loved your enemy and you
spoil them rotten well Jesus said you'll
heat coals on their head and stuff like
that it seems to me that it works better
if you're not trying to hurt them so
like if your intention is to hurt them
by spoiling them rotten me maybe the
magic doesn't work that's not it's just
simple justice if you're so sometimes
two actions with different understanding
and motivation can produce different
justice okay so like this applies to
several things but like loving your
enemy you know I I don't really
understand the ear head there's kind of
like air head Christians that are like
love our interview yeah you know I don't
really understand it's kind of weird
doesn't really it's kinda like it's
weird okay I don't know what it is but
like there was a the the British may
have made fun of a missionary back in
about 1988 he went over to Lebanon and
he got killed and the British headline
was he loved his enemies missionary he
loved his enemies and it doesn't quite
look good you have to be careful because
God said he's he's he's angry at
creationists for bringing shame with
their stupidity so God wants glory and
respect
and that should sober you up there's
kind of a there was an old commercial
for IBM computers back in back when
there were that they were making
compatible computers that were cheaper
and then there was the IBM and and the
the commercial headline or the
commercial motto or the commercial
jingle was no one ever got fired for
buying an IBM and what it is is it's
cowardice it's kind of like the parable
of the talents you know well I'm so
scared we can't possibly get in trouble
for creationism can we it seems like it
seems like a safe bet it's like it's
it's coward logic right coward logic is
well no way can God punish us for
creationism God saying fuck you okay so
it's it's cowardice you know and you
should that should be a heads up you
know there's a thing I realized I've
realized this grace phenomena the angels
will you know how if you're asleep and
you just kind of sleepwalk and you do
the creationism but if you get a heads
up that holy shit we got to evaluate
everything for stupidity and so now
suddenly you're if if that if
creationism was wrong we can't afford to
live as zombies suddenly we have to be
at our highest mental state in all of
our thinking if that was if that was
wrong it's like whoa that's a wake up
and then oh that Oh that'll wake you up
and so now you're gonna be alert and
that higher state where you're you're
running you're running close to the edge
of your ability that's where you get the
grace thing I was trying to explain the
other day I tried to throw a rock and
use the Jedi force and the first time I
just threw it kind of like like
just hoping for luck with no no effort
that's kind of like the creationism
where oh well just sleepwalking it's got
to be safe
the second time I threw the rock it was
with with it's hard to explain but I
tried I tried to use my ability and get
on the edge and you know what I realized
I was singing with my voice and if your
voice cracks the nearest analogy I can
give for this phenomena of grace is if
you try to sing and you push yourself
right to the limit but you don't crack
your voice and that's that's what grace
is that's so it's so so the wake-up call
from creationism whoa now we got a like
now you got to go through life and make
your voice not crack you gotta like you
gotta be you gotta push it to the limit
and not crack your voice that's the
alertness and stuff but then I realized
hey wait a second this is like Satan
bringing me to the top of the temple
like Jesus and saying if you bow down
and worship me I'll give you all these
vast domains and so then just kind of
like hey wait how did I become a slave
hold on a second here why am I gonna go
through life pushing myself for this
grace so I think you might wanna well
anyway it occurred to me hold on wait a
second here obviously it's like oh this
is awesome if we do this grace thing we
get blessing supernatural blessing hold
on a second you just made yourself a
slave did you realize that suddenly
you're sucking Satan's cock it's it's
not Satan at some other angel it's like
hold on do I really want to be a slave
to an angel you know it's like we can
promise you a nice complexion and your
eyes your eyes will be good your health
would be good but it's like hold on a
second here yeah but I'm fucking sucking
a cock all day long I'm trying to like
keep my voice from cracking and pushing
it to the limit it's like hold on hold
on wait wait
wait maybe hold on hold on a second you
I just woke up a slave hold on`,

`so I didn't I didn't did I didn't send a
video to Diana before she left she left
somewhere no I could have if I had done
it right maybe it would have worked they
got the other hand I got the other hand
you think this hand automatically adapts
to the dynamics of what do you think
symmetrical there's this kitchen on the
first try this still with you personally
well okay well so I don't think it's
going to be pretty interesting to watch
mr. Carey play bayonet with raw okay
so war
oh are you thinking what I'm thinking
there's a schoolyard not in front of the
children
shit it's my price breathe okay
I don't know what that was hey let's I
don't know but you gotta think is
something new and clever because like
that's do you masturbate
what Olli it is Brock oh okay I fucked
it up didn't get first rank Oh Gary walk
oh did you see that
I almost got the bugger yeah oh do the
left hand you idiot you gotta switch
hands
you want your left hand good at aiming
right cuz it
what if you do you like your right hand
when you're like gaming did it like you
left him when you're not aiming it in
great what about the magic and the magic
aiming hand did you see with the left
hand I got some magic let's put the left
hand yeah your magic Andy oh okay so
whatever whatever the master
masturbatory I have gone to masturbatory
uh let's complete this bugger all right
one two three playing go tango okay fuck
you ready one two three three
okay can we here's the plan we're gonna
flick that fucker like that right pretty
okay fucking shit so we want miracles in
shit no no it's just this is the
Internet's full of this fucking shit so
ways I should probably go do some
physics because if you want physics girl
you probably need the piece no you don't
need to be missed you need to be the
best person that you were meant to be
and I think I should drum because fuck
yeah
let's play something like recognizable
hey hey we need to break another one oh
ho no no no no state leads down on that
okay can we fix it what if we make it
like like this is like our secret we get
some wax put some wax right there and
then we like we got our like our secret
seek your dad can we fix it yeah feather
that's a foul
yes that's a party polish don't do that
don't make fun you damn it it's not
funny you do enough of those in there
like your fucking come on you're you're
gross okay you're all fucked up you
can't be doing that so why is this
elevated at that level do you think this
is for acoustics like what are the magic
acoustics of this fucker why do we have
a wind chime that are tuned because it's
going to be the holy the holiest song of
the year when the wind blows or some
shit I don't know so we need the Pyxis
like this is not it's not morning after
we fix this skit in this evening is duct
tape foot yeah of course
that's again that's gonna look at it we
don't want to hide it on the other hand
it's gonna look ugly so what is the
right answer
so uh it doesn't have to be very strong
did you see that I caught it okay you'd
fuck up the wood floor you gotta be able
to spin this book good okay just dad put
that there
mom goes on that apparently she crashed
the threshold of something um so what do
we got here oh my god duct tape where we
want to be with somebody how else could
we fix it something that's not um a
blemish is really don't want it we don't
really want to hide once you just tell
Dad and put some fucking clear tape
cuz that's fuckin Jay come on you know
that's gonna know I can't hide it can I
did
there's some other strengths why don't
you fucking die it with some other
Street it's a white string ah there's a
fucking white string oh my god what if I
restoring the whole fucking thing cuz
Lee that's what I'm gonna do today
dad I restrung your whole fucking thing
in my job your wind chime what do you
think it's glamorizes what if what if
he's using that string for something
probably not brah right no no the other
side you fucking idiot Rob your wheat
wheat oh those two latches off wha
okay now now we got to uh I did what if
I make it better that's what a monk does
he makes it better is that how you
farted party loud fucking party pod oh
you should have seen X it was awesome
about you can't see what I see okay so
it bounced off this and I fucking caught
it is put yeah so don't brag okay okay
so let's do this fast because we don't
fuck around the clock we're on the month
clock a monk does not fuck around okay a
monk is fucking on a fucking time clock
because we got a serious monkey or monk
out of this shit okay we're on fucking
time clock look at the time clock monk
amongst a clock can we need scissors we
need three changers what am I like the
razor blade no one can't use a race boy
why not because this is brutal oh I'm I
like hundred of I use my cash what you
must go with the flow because if you get
outside of here so get outside of
yourself then you start getting skids oh
my scintillating okay we got this shit
what it what's the best kind which dad
can like yellow I like yellow we think
yellow would look fantasy fucking like
make it really cool fucking bad-ass to
the bone
fuck yeah man cuz that's what I'm one
does all day fucking make yourself happy
because you don't got Diana so what are
we going to do we are going to wouldn't
review three of them are we didn't hurry
yeah we're in a hurry cuz we're in a
time clock cuz fuck yeah okay yellow
we're dead get this you probably still
stole it off of something no it's not
stolen it's been unwound that's a
mystery why has this been wounded
unwound this trip you might has a trip
what are we fucking sure like oh yeah
because like we wanted like the Jewish
people they respect laws okay
because you don't fuck with booking you
don't fuck with the Ark of the Covenant
because that shit will get you killed
okay we're going to make some fab
fabulous
okay that Ark of the Covenant and get
you killed so we're not fuckin rewire
this fucker now what do you think the UH

you`,

`so good and bad balance in life if you
if you do any meditation on what the
fuck a monk is thinking like a cassock
herbart Zuckerberg what do you think a
monk is thinking Zuckerberg Sean I have
no idea they're complete idiot
no they're not complete idiots you gotta
like do some forensic psychology how
could you get bunch of people to give up
good things you know it's like what the
fuck Zuckerberg think about this how
long before you say fuck this if you
have any you have any wisdom you learn
we can't tolerate shit if you're not
getting results it's only so much you
can tolerate without results matter of
fact God said that uh kind of ruins the
sacrifice when you start getting results
like if you start seeing your face
improve like Moses or some shit
suddenly it's not it's not it's not as
noble but something like that so like
yes Zuckerberg Zuckerberg hey we what do
you think of those those monks that like
you know they give up all the good
things in life so I could berg's like
are complete idiots like you really
think they would like do this like for
year after year just for no reason it's
like yeah you're fucking complete idiot
so like
this is this is some fucking classic
Divine Comedy okay Bill Gates says um he
says uh life's not fair get used to it
that's the funniest divine comedy I have
ever fucking heard okay that's pretty
fucking the minors here's the VLA how
many one-hit wonders are there okay so
you know you know why you have one-hit
wonders
let's do a little bit analysis here okay
highs and lows balance good and bad
balances if good and bad balances you
got a poor Liverpool boy it's poor
suddenly now it takes it takes a special
kind of person to to be a two-hit wonder
three it wonder you know what that
person has to do they have to keep
themselves humble basically have to not
indulge because it basically ruined that
you know so like so I was thinking about
this and it's kind of like but then you
get kind of an ugly thing where you
don't want to take rewards that's kind
of fucked
[Applause]
it's like it what do you fuck you but I
think it's kind of like you know what's
God gonna say it's like no no don't
reward me don't reward me God's got this
fuck you I won't
good um so uh yeah there's kind of this
weird masochism there's a lot of people
that are crazy Catholic masochist it's
like what the fuck man
this is kind of like you ain't quite on
a rational level on the other hand I
don't really I don't really know if it's
better to be rational or not because
like if you get to starts getting ugly
both ways man can have the crazy
masochists like what the fuck man you're
freaking psycho man you got some sick
issues and God's probably just going to
say fuck you little retard fuck yourself
that's what I do if I Scott go ahead
take this fucking masochist fucking you
know looking anyway I don't really know
if I don't know the so then you get some
crazy Jew or something's like let's
document all the laws of justice
uh you know really got a bad feeling
about that I think you just want to like
you know anyway so like Rob let mr. gun
so like yeah I don't know if you really
want I don't know if you really want to
get to two wise you know so said nose
hairs leaking nose hairs if he knows he
knows too much and the AP knows too much
even new shoes so I'm talking like Seth
wrote as name Seth Rogen Phil house last
yeah like that guy said okay so so we're
going to do the the readings okay so
like my mom was like a Lecter like
turned like per lecture like burger so
and mr. Dodd says the one thing we can
change a wise man is strong in a man of
knowledge increases power this may shock
you but I believe the single most
significant decision I can make on a
day-to-day basis is my choice of
attitude it's more important in my past
my education my bankroll my success or
failure Fame or pain what other people
think of me or say about me my
circumstances are my position the
attitude I choose keeps me going or
cripples my progress is it alone fuels
my fire or assaults my hope my attitudes
are right there's no barrier too high no
Valley too deep no dream too extreme no
challenge too great for me yet we must
admit that we spend more of our time
concentrating and fretting over the
things that can't be changed then we do
giving attention to the one thing we can
change our choice of attitude that's
that but you know this book has really
helped me a lot I you can see I fucking
read it like it's better than the
fucking Bible I think so actually
but anyway so like Charlie choice of
attitude yeah Chuck Swindoll wisdom for
the way give it to Diana as a birthday
present so this is better than wedding
ring
what Oh No did you flick what you Siegel
anyway it's like a choice of attitude
it's like what yeah there have been
times where like I've been stuck in hell
it's like no I know what I can do I can
change my fucking attitude there's a lot
of truth to that`,
