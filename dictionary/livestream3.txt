go-go-go what is your problem
there we go
okay
I'm going to write an email
she doesn't respond
anyway we're gonna find some some topic
to get God's response
let's see
what's a good article
nothing good
about
what the fuck is it
no we're not doing that
so
so this is Clio
Snippets
this pick some random words
so there we go
more okay so we get a response a couple
of minutes
we're going to NASD 7:27
so here's n ist they have
you know we could go to other random
sources
so they publish first beacon generated
numbers cannot be predicted before they
are published
second the public time-bound
authenticated nature allows user
application to prove to anybody that it
used truly random numbers not known
before a certain point in time third
this proof can be presented offline and
at any point in the future
can't believe we did this topic
the French 5 2 9 5 3 oh we picked the
first 5 decimal digits
shoo
and this is that were on his feet
what
blood what does blood snow I know I put
smells like
Oh
we're asking to talk about
let's go - ready
Christmas
really stupid
really stupid
okay so now we go
I'm not worthy
Hey
okay let's see
[Music]
33
[Music]
33
e o 966 no they don't
96 809 96 a toad 996 what did I close
that window
dammit ito 996
that was eight fold 1996 what are we
talking about almost closed
I forgot what we were talking about et
okay
okay
everything from Microsoft is a sour note
that you don't want to hear Bill Gates
is a sour note that you don't want to
like make it stop what do you think
mister guard
Oh
wicked wicked you're going down on
motherfuckers everything is a sour note
know what this is about
let's just go get one directly fuck it
Wow Oh let's just do this oh you know we
should do we're alive or did Scott
wasn't ready I tricked he tricked God
and let's see if he's ready
hee hee the niggers
auction
hey what happened
okay let's let's do some more let's find
some more shit now it's the best time
just uh
Ebanks
on these water
well we didn't do that instruction
so in inside temple OS is
inside temple OS in the compiler
directory there's a file called opcodes
and it has the up codes with the
addressing modes and I didn't do SSE
mmHg but the only I did
I put the register names so I started
doing them but I didn't do him so you
can't do em mes s MMX sse because just
fuck you
I don't know if - for me who is it who
says because fuck you it sounds like -
God is the boss you're not the boss of
me
some people don't know that integer
arithmetic is faster than floating-point
no you know what we're gonna do we are
going to go to random.org and get number
no it's gonna hop it's we're going to
take the first five decimal digits
and so oh six seven one six oh six seven
one six
six everyone six
normally I can see
so somebody else can do it I don't know
if we want it I think it's crap
if you're doing matrix math otherwise
it's crap
a lot of people
there's a lot of important matrix math
maybe down
she doesn't talk to me
so that's cool
[Music]
United or let's see who's gonna win the
United herb Li Chester and what the hell
is that
Arsenal we're doing uh put a thousand
four seven two six three four seven two
sixty three and the Lord says there's
disassemblers disassemblers I have heard
the congregation of meaningful doers and
will not sit with the wicked I will wash
my hands with innocency so will I
compass the altar Oh Lord that I may
publish with the voice of Thanksgiving
and tell of all thy wondrous works lord
I have loved the habitation of the house
and the place where thy honor dwelleth
gather not my soul with sinners nor my
life with bloody men in whose hands is
mischief in the right hand is full of
bribes but as for me and I won't walk in
my integrity redeem me and be merciful
unto me my foot standeth
and then even place in the congregation
why bless the Lord
how about that a little miracle
let's do another one
who is I don't know you don't know who
that is
they gave authorities the slip in a
Prius now the quorum of wanted men in
the world are stealing our Toyota let's
go places back in the day sailors used
to tell stories about these monster
waves these waves were enormous two to
three times taller than the tallest
average waves even in stormy conditions
and big enough to sink ships as big as
ocean liners and oil platforms they
would talk about being battered by this
giant wave and barely living to tell the
tale and these waves would form in the
open ocean randomly spontaneously and
without an obvious cause but people do
exaggerate and scientists who study the
ocean didn't buy it these tales of
so-called rogue waves
we're happening far too frequently to be
true and according to their calculations
rogue waves could form based on a
phenomenon known as superposition when
two waves combine crest to crest the
waves double in size and when they
combine softer crest I think let's see
what mister God says about that
49:54
49
thus I cleansed thus cleansed a them
from all strangers and appointed the
wards of the priests of the Levites
every one in his business and for the
wood offering at times appointed and for
the firstfruits remember me oh my god
for good a book of Esther now i came to
pass in the days of Ezra's this is a
hazardous which reigned from India even
the Ethiopian over 107 Tony provinces
then in those days when the King
hazardous 7 the throne of his kingdom
which was nutrition the palace in the
third year the rain he made feast and
DAHS princes and servants the power of
Persia and media Betty
the nobles and princes of the provinces
being before him should the riches of
his glorious Kingdom in honor of his
excellent majesty medicine amenities
okay enough of that
Oh dud I guess I don't know
so
yes
so
she uh
[Music]
she was a
where she worked as a software engineer
designing mobile apps so she programs I
guess she went to MIT the other day I
was speculating if she used Linux and
somebody said that at MIT they would
laugh at you if you used Windows so
that's kind of cool anyway so she could
do it what you think you think she let's
see what God says I think she could do
SSC MMX
where are we going here
so this is
she's got better things to do to be
honest
doesn't she have better things to do
I think she's
she's good in front of the cameras
then everybody's good in front of the
camera
what do you think mr. garden good in
front of the camera
what do you think is Stallman mr. god
let's go
to 165 3
one six five three
and the chariots of Israel cried unto
the Lord for he had nine hundred
chariots of iron 20 years he he mightily
oppressed the children of Israel Deborah
a prophetess the wife of that but does
she judged Israel at that time as she
developed under the palm tree of Deborah
between Rama and Bethel in a mountain
hear from the children of Israel came up
to her for judgment and she sent and
called Barack the son of AB Noah out of
condition if Tolley and said unto Him
hath not the Lord God of Israel
commanded saying go and dress toward tab
or and take with the ten thousand men of
the children of Naphtali and the
children of Zebulun and I will draw unto
thee to the river Kishin Sisera the
captain of Japanese army with this
chariots and his multitude and I will
deliver him into thine hand and Barak
said and earth if that will go with me
and I will go but if thou will not go
with me then I will not go
prophetess
so let's find something yeah see
something you want God to talk about
quantum entanglement is boring
so this person probably doesn't so I
have a lesson to teach okay we're gonna
do a hard court lesson me okay so so
there are a lot of
let's say we're keeping track of pennies
okay so it's important to keep in mind
cache miss so what we do is we do these
twice Oh
what I should do oops
what what what what you idiot
this kind of weird
okay it makes sense okay anyway
so look at the time but what do you
notice it's six times slower or five
times about five times or whatever or
okay so let's take that there are a lot
of I find the stupidest people
if I'm using integer math they assume
it's because they don't have a
floating-point processor I liked when I
was young the float was ten times slower
now it's about five times slower anyway
I can't even talk to somebody who's so
stupid so if you can use integer use in
a jerk now how can you use integer for
fractions well let's
okay so
close to 500 5-4 see what happens now my
compiler is not very good I guess what
you have to say so it looks to be the
same so what can we do if so if so if
you want to do money I learned this at
Ticketmaster if you want to do money put
pennies into an integer if you want to
do money put pennies into an integer and
that's the best I guess some people have
to have fractions of a penny not very
often so what about if we have 100 times
sign
okay so what if we have some decimal
now look we have error it's supposed to
be eighty four point one now what can we
do in order to make this work I'll tell
you what you do you take this shift it
thirty two and when you print it
Oh
fuck that out
okay
well this is embarrassing
do you have any bow you know what this
might not work
let's do this
okay I really hate life I'm not having a
good day
let's divide by
oh that's kind of weird
why didn't it convert it I might have a
compiler but what though we are way
fucked Oh
first of all let's change it to you I
don't think that's I am happy let's
print this maybe it's overflowing no
it's not
50 should be a hundred times sign 84
okay so it's 84 we're adding
oh this is weird
roughly two
thirty-two
got any ideas people this is
embarrassing
oh did I do that
so you know the two f64 might not work
I can look at the machine code
oh it's overflowing that that's no
excuse
eighty four point one four okay maybe
let's divide by
for well
84g we're getting warm now
there we go look at that that's
beautiful now what the truck is the
problem
are we overflowing why would we 100
million what is this honor million
oh we're overflowing you idiot I always
have this problem this happened the
other day okay
so we take 10 to the 32 times sign and
[Music]
so
we have some error but the time is three
times faster so this my friends is
what's known as fixed point math and
anyway a lot of people a lot of people
they they make me furious when they say
it's for when I say it's for
no floating-point processor make me
furious now on a with the better
compiler is the results might be closer
that's possible anyway so let's go ahead
and let's look at let's talk to God
we're going to get some radioactive
numbers or radioactive hot biz so this
genuine random numbers generated by
radioactive decay we're going to take
the first five decimal digits nine nine
seven eight zero nine nine seven eight
zero nine nine seven eight zero
she'll stand afar off for the fear of
her torment weeping and wailing and
saying alas alas the great city that was
clothed in fine linen and purple and
scarlet and decked with gold and
precious stones and pearls for an hour
so great riches has come to nought and
every shipmaster and all the company in
ships and sailors and as many as trade
by sea stood afar off and cried when
they saw the smoke of her burning saying
what city is like unto this great city
and they cast dust on their heads and
cried weeping and wailing saying alas
the last a great city wherein were made
rich although that had ships in the sea
by reason of her costliness for in one
hour is she made desolate rejoice over
her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and
prophets for God avenged you on her and
a mighty angel took up a stone like a
great millstone and cast it into the sea
saying thus with violence shall that
great city Babylon be thrown down and
she shall be found no more at all what
I have I have tests
[Music]
this is 168 tests each about a couple
seconds

amos and they said unto Him thus saith
Hezekiah this day is the day of trouble

you're my witnesses saith the Lord and

yeah I can tuck what my texture
so we're in the test suite
why don't you
if you're writing a text editor why
don't you go to the colonel directory
and look at Edie this is my emergency
editor it's only it's about it's 300
lines of code and I suggest you do that
so I'm gonna post a link
so my editor is ultra deluxe and
complicated my emergency editor is
probably what you want to look at
there is probably what you want to look
at
if you want to know what my editor can
do
we're doing this
so my editor is
I use it for my command line and this is
it has page commands and it can do
columns of text like this it can do
graphics and columns a text that has
page width it has margins it has so the
full editor editor is probably not what
you want to do it has graphics and
source code it has active links it has
syntax highlighting it's it's really
deluxe that's why I showed you the the
emergency editor the command line is the
same editor and it has links and it has
macros links and macros this is a prompt
PT
there's a there's a routine this is the
this is the heart of the editor recalc
it does wordwrap it does anyway
so yet your editor is altered deluxe no
fonts it doesn't do fonts so it's it's
not that integers
so this is the heart the heart of the
editor the recalc it redraws everything
everything
so as you can imagine there's a there's
a big switch statement with all the
keystrokes all the keys have their own
there's
this is this is
cursor left is kind of complicated
I think
the editor is really complicated I I'm
not gonna waste my time talking about it
I could well
it's awful
there's a lot of people in denial on God
these people are in denial on God
so it's
nine seven seven three seven
well what was manifest in these last
times for you who by him to believe in
God that raised him up from the dead and
gave him glory in your faith and hope
might be in God seeing you have purified
your souls in obeying the truth through
the spirit unto unfeigned love with the
Brethren see that you love one another
with the pure heart fervently be born
again not of corruptible by the Word of
God which liveth and abideth forever for
all flesh is a grass is this grass and
the glory of man is this a flower of
grass the grass withereth and the flower
thereof falleth away but the word of the
Lord endureth forever and this is the
word points by the gospel is preached
unto you wherefore laying aside all
malice and guile and all guile hypocrisy
is in envies
all evil speaking as newborn babes
desire the sincere milk of the word that
he may grow thereby
that was a dud more or less not
miraculous what'd you think of the race
mister God oh come on you get a cookie
can you hear me now taunting dudes that
just golfer dudes I just got for
revolution tomorrow credibly threats
you're lucky now that I think about it
enough Obama drama I Regis oh hell no
your negress wrath stuff hasta hey
that's right strip application off the
record and that's all folks driving be
right back don't mention it I didn't see
that nope I'll think about it
not very miraculous
[Music]
I redraw everything 30 times a second so
[Music]
as a matter of fact I even redraw what's
not on the screen if we go in the Bible
as a matter of fact we're using we're
using 53% of uh CPU so it's it's doing
the whole Bible I redraw everything I
what I I did do an optimization for okay
so the the command line window is a
document and you can it's it's the
editor so the command line is my editor
and what I did okay so I I have that I
told you that the recalculate is the
heart of my editor and that goes through
the whole document actually
when you do this it only does the the
bottom part of the document so as a
matter of fact there
I don't redraw the whole document when
I'm now what if we put the cursor right
here it does from the cursor down
so
so when it redraws it it goes from the
cursor down does the remainder there's a
reason why I redraw the whole document
watch what I'm gonna do I'm going to do
I'm gonna do a margin control L page
setting left margin for T okay so we
have a margin command now watch what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna do what are we on we
are on the line I don't know that's okay
I'm gonna say control control L cursor
movement we are going to go up the page
- mm so
it's kind of ridiculous how powerful my
editor is
it redraws the whole document 30 times a
second but it's really powerful
oh it also uh anyway so I I placed a
priority on features what okay see what
God says God says AB stiffly positively
no more tears from I'm afraid you're
fired
sure burning I love this climate radio
beats adjust for inflation
you never know Jesus that the way we
move there it is resume you'll see your
rich Cluj are you feeling like a
catastrophe server sector you're out of
your mind
threads now that I think about it but of
course from sad naughty fun no pain
mine is better mine you don't need if
you want to do assembly
watch this well you can just put
assembly instructions
it recognizes by the out code it
recognizes the out codes
so we printed hello world I'm a I am the
best programmer on earth I was given a
divine intellect in order to make this
god I consulted God the whole time and
he puppeted me
what do you think of Obama
two six eight five six
through an abuse me but his armor-bearer
would not for he was so afraid therefore
sought took the sword and fell upon it
and when its armor bear saw that's all
was dead he felt likewise upon his sword
and died with him so Saul died in his
three sons and armor baron all has been
that same day together and when the men
of Israel that were on the other side of
the valley and they that were on the
other side of Jordan saw that the men of
Israel fled and that saw and his sons
were dead they forsake the cities and
fled and the Philistines came and dwelt
in them and he came to Bassin tomorrow
that the Philistines came stripped of
slain that they found saw his three sons
fallen in Gilboa
Obama is amazing is pretty much the CIA
is a seus they're fighting God as hard
as they can
we do you think of this mr. cart see
something about this
you are gonna make God's temple and I
what are you fucking confusing people
for 14 nanometer could become a long
note I'm fucking talking about
maybe they're talking about the assembly
that I just did
you're gonna make
a divinely designed chip are you going
to design the chip God
okay let's go
five four six three seven
there shall no evil happen to the just
but the wicked shall be filled with
mischief lying lips are an abomination
to the Lord but they that deal truly are
is delight a prudent man conceal his
knowledge but the heart of fools
proclaimeth foolishness the hand of the
diligent shall bear rule but the
slothful shall be under tribute
heaviness and heart of man maybe that
stoop but a good word maketh a glad the
righteous is more excellent than his
neighbor but the way of the wicked
seduces them a slothful man roast not
what which he took in hunting but the
substance of a diligent man is precious
in the way of righteousness is life and
in a way thereof there is no death
intel is evil that's why they're
struggling they used to be good I would
when I'm in charge I am firing this man
has fired little motherfucker made the
chip slower and he's trying to make him
tiny he's trying to get rid of the
desktop fuck that fucking nigger doing
the opposite of what I said he's fired
you wouldn't see how to make a built-in
function what functions should we make
I wouldn't count
tricky
stuff working with my compiler I
wouldn't count on tricky stuff working I
should say I made a new language and it
works the way it works
see if we have any questions
see if we have any questions
[Music]
so spider-man is a homo
pretty much
I spider-man homo mr. God
the nigger brain cannot understand what
a random number is the nigger brain
cannot understand what a random number
is
seven 909 zone
um
if you read this god is not the god of
the dead but of the living
Jesus says God is not the god of the
dead but of the living I asked God if
the world was perfectly just he asked if
I was going and lazy
so there's justice in this life and I'm
very doubtful of this another life
what do you think of that
God makes elephants
what are we gonna do
Oregon and New Mexico's that was Indiana
but you understand how people see this
as exceptional basically both candidates
understanding and recognizing the fact
that they're not going to win on a first
ballot and making a deal essentially
saying you take this date I'll take this
date yeah well for both of these
individuals the second ballot is
critical to getting the nomination and
for John Kasich side you know he wants
to have that opportunity because he is
of these three candidates still in the
race
we only one who has proven that he can
win in November and ultimately there's
no point in this entire exercise of
having a primary process like this if
Republicans cannot win in November the
goal is
how many of you know that 16 words in
President Bush's State of the Union
address
how many know my wife's name now how can
you know one and not the other
when did the question move from why are
we going to war - who is this man's wife
I asked the first question but somebody
else asked them and it worked because
none of us know the truth the offense
that was committed was not committed yes
it was not admitted against my wife it
was committed against all of you but
that makes you angry
or feel misrepresented do something
when Benjamin Franklin left Independence
Hall just after the second draft he was
approached by a woman on the street the
woman said mr. Franklin
what manner of government have you
bequeathed us when Franklin said a
republic
the responsibility of a country is not
in the hands of a privileged few we are
strong and we are free from tyranny as
long as each one of us remembers his or
her duty as a citizen theocracy bitches
say hello to theocracy bitches
I didn't mean that
I didn't know I was sexist
I'm not sexist
the accuracy bitches
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]

[Music]
bust us some time travel mr. GaN bust
out some time travel time travel on my
mark
time travel three eight five four six
so king robe on strengthen himself in
Jerusalem and rain for Rob em was one
and 40 years old when he began to reign
and he reigned 17 years in Jerusalem so
you wish the Lord had just amount of all
the tribes of Israel to put his name
there and his mother's name was not
ma'am Nima and emanate this and he did
evil because he prepared not his heart
to seek the Lord the actual bone first
and last are they not written in the
books if she Maya the prophet and if I
do the seared concerning genealogies and
there were wars between or o of them and
Jeroboam continually in robe and slept
with his father's and was buried in the
City of David and jabbed at Jeff and son
rained in estate well
no wasn't very funny god that was lame
genealogies
well
[Music]
okay so here's here's a three gigahertz
time timer the three gigahertz timer is
sufficient
what do you think is Stephen Hawking
mister God
there's an Oracle in the Jewish temple
this is an Oracle eight five nine six
four eight five nine six four
and Jesus said unto him I am the bread
of life he they come to me shall never
hunger he that believeth on me shall
never thirst but I say unto you that ye
also have seen me and believed not all
that the father giveth me shall come up
come to me and him that cometh to me and
no wise cast out for it came down from
heaven not to do my own will but the
will of him that sent me and this is the
Father's will which has sent me that of
all which he give me I should there's
nothing but should raise it up again on
the last day
so that was a belated reference to the
battleship
hot bitch Jesus nuclear decay look
search for hot bits in Google
okay let's ask about Trump
how about immigration let's ask about
immigration God said to castrate
immigrants
okay we're going to take the first five
decimal digits this is the Bible it's
got a hundred thousand lines almost
exactly I'm trying to dammit
how can I grab the bottom I want
son of a bitch there's some stupid shit
in Linux white anyway fuck
oh I know how never mind okay um there's
we want five five digits so a three
three six seven eight
they're all decimal three three six
seven eight three three six seven eight
every man to their tents and Josh in
Israel took amazing a king of Judah son
of Joh Cinna vet has dia and break down
the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of
Ephraim unto the horn and gate for
hundred cubits and he took all the gold
and silver and all the vessels that were
found in the house of the Lord into the
treasures that king's house and hostages
and returned Samaria now the rest of the
actual Josh which he did and which is
okay Hobbit
this pisses me off
I think if you draw
how do you
there's a alt shift or something like
that
fuck
ah
I was just trying to make the window
smaller the motherfucker in Linux is
fucked up
[Music]
your call is very
[Music]
[Music]
I almost banned the person that said USB
doesn't work
they came real close to banning them
