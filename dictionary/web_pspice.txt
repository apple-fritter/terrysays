you know what I want to do I want to do
something fun for me
okay so this is fun
let's see what a kid with the toy box
I'd never used this actually I did use
it once by Thomas I tried to bias a
transistor no mother fucker wouldn't
work I could swear the fucking simulator
was broken so let's have some fun
let's take a 741
Oh
let's kind of make an oscillator what do
you say let's make an oscillator how
about one kilohertz let's make a one
kilohertz oscillator okay folks how can
we make a one kilohertz oscillator we
want positive feedback and we want it to
be one kilohertz how hard can it be
who can you do it with a single stage I
think you need about you can get up I
think you can get about factor up you
can get what do you call it well factor
of 10 with each stage so how would we
now we can just if you just throw a
resistor and capacitor into the circuit
that's probably what it's going to be
how hard can it be
what if I just take a resistor and
capacitor okay let's get it let's get a
unity amplifier to begin with let's just
get started here so how do we do that
you want negative feedback what you do
is you look at the circuit diagram for
okay
repeat okay rotate motherfucker I told
you rotate
let's okay
and you rotate huh stupid thing
okay ah I think we just do this don't we
we just connect that to ground connect
that down so
oh I know okay I remember okay
so put this puppy over here what are you
doing
Oh date when you rotate the fucker
vertically
split horizontally rotate why is it here
now okay
so put this Booker and another one of
these footers hey what Shabbat okay
there we go we will start with the unity
came up man
no it's good
I think we want about 10k for the
resistors why are we if we're doing
signal level well after doing opposite
you can get power op amps it's been 10
year it's been 20 years since I I don't
know I used some I don't know how big of
a power amplifier you can get aa pin but
they're more or less
where's the fucking wire like wire
motherfucker come on with lossless
transmission is of course we want loss
that's right kidding me with a fuck dumb
fuck and just one fucking wire I don't
want that
fucking drink okay let's see
passive bitch hey let's make gaya
let's make gay uh hey uh let's make a
voltage step up oh that would be cool
would that be cool that would be cool
we'll chop a this okay let's make a
first Oh will you make an oscillator
yeah then we can like run it through a
turn into square wave and drive some
transistors and make a voltage step up
or something how the fuck do we make a
fucking wire gotta be shitting me maybe
you have to buy that pay money if you
want wires you have to pay money
you got any ideas fuck sign oh yeah I
need to sign in we win okay I think I
did this before no locking I didn't get
very far either how did you know I tried
to make it I tried to make I didn't get
very far
this is embarrassing what the fuck
hey I got wires how did they get wires I
was trying to do it from memory
if you don't look at that cuz it's awful
okay so how did I get wires
diana likes inductors so we're going to
do some inductors this to you okay so
part
okay
so passive we put I don't worry let's
put another one
I'm capable of fuck roti I would out
with them now you tell me okay so
generic parts okay why don't we let's do
let's do this fucker realistic let's do
that let's delete it
Oh
can't I pick a 741
okay hello you know it's Terry yes Terry
Andrew yeah is Terry not today I'll try
and find him
okay bye
oh how about that oh okay here we go
we're cooking with gas
okay we want to ground it okay fire
George
okay I just one round and I please have
ground hooker here you got hey yeah we
want one of those
no that's really do it okay so plus no
no no Oh what am I talking about
it's AC it doesn't have a fucking plus
okay so
what are you doing idiot cut that fucker
there we go okay
that looks better okay let's properties
do you see let's make this fucker wait
no not DC what are you doing DC we don't
want DC okay this is a we're doing a
unity gain amplifier
I won boat sounds good these we would
okay we want diana likes inductors so
you know our unity let's put a square
wave we put a square wave Union fucker
okay wooden killer beautiful
okay and let's connect them for good
Wow where is the fucking ground fucker
maybe it's it
[Music]
where is the fucking ground there oh
okay that makes it
so interpretive dance they create you on
who says you don't do interpretive dance
and fucking interpretive dances off okay
and let's go ahead and connect up a
testing no I want an oscilloscope a come
on oscilloscope one oscilloscope fuck
you
are you shitting me I want to fucking
oscilloscope
how about if I just run it
please see buyers reading talking about
transient response oh no we don't this
is too easy
you project simulation it's supposed to
be unity game you bribed 8k I'm not
having fun are we having fun over not
having fun okay well I've done this all
when I was young and this was new I
would have fun but now this is not fun
frequency to point what are you talking
about 2.5 kilohertz where the fuck did
that come from
I gave you one killers the number one
rule of AC analysis is if you put in one
Gillard's
you get out one Gillard's okay that's
pretty funny okay what the fuck believe
me there is no component that changes
the frequency except that voltage tanker
up the clock divider what do you call it
but the number line flip-flop there
there's no magic frequency changer they
don't make that kind of component the
fuck is this shit
frequency changer that would be cool
maybe it's not grounded or something or
you think
okay I want okay we got networks okay
so they're numbered okay so let's take a
look at what network we got here it is
network number one set net name be out
and we sit let me feed okay now let's
look at ABC analysis okay let's run the
fucker
he's yours mine start frequency stop
frequency would he talk oh is this a
sweep are you kidding me
the fuck what what are we looking at
here the fuck is this oh this is for
bode plot ah
but I already told you the source with
the focuses you seen up yet we just want
these enable simulations transient let's
see well that will certainly accomplish
it the foot
again no no no now fuck you
this is what happened the last time I
use this program nothing happened
this is a fucking
I didn't set a DC voltage the fuck is
that I told you
I fucking told you what I want the fuck
were you doing I think you have to pay
money
see oh that looks better now
run run niggers what does the KKK
motorcycle sound like Brenda you're new
you're ending
fuck this
focusing put fuck you very much
what what is your fucking problem
hey see now no I don't want to fucking
bode plot the fuck is this
I have a fucking voltage source what is
the fucking source you're talking about
a sweep now I have a fucking voltage
source what are you talking about a
passive network or something what the
fuck
well thanks for that
that this is a fucking voltage source
is there a port in no well if you told
me the input then maybe we can do the
motherfucker sources are we having fun
no we're not having fun
fuck this
see
you
you
so check this out so there's a there's a
few different types of oscillators and
whoo
whatever so I just wanted to see
so anyway off we don't want to do that
let's make a uh let's make a voltage
let's make a charging circuit for uh
okay so
you know what I want to do let's make a
so watch what we do
is this going to
I want to square wave why don't you give
me a square wave you motherfucker
frequency modulation what I want a
fucking square wave
you
oh we do want we do want offset of one
I'm going to make a chopper circuit to
uh get some voltage I've never done this
yeah I have okay so we take
do you know what you're doing now I
don't know what I'm doing
how about a Darlington switch we want a
switching transistor wasp it may be is
that what we want
I want to darling come on a tip 120 how
about that you got one of those it could
be this shouldn't be too hard I'm a
little bit scared of MOSFETs just
because
in jail
so I wonder if this simulates parts
getting fried that would be pretty funny
I don't think this simulates parts
getting fried okay so what we want to do
is chop an inductor and
okay so
[Music]
let's see if we can make this fucker
explode there okay this ought to be cool
No
I only put a diode across inductors but
we want the fucker to explode
okay so we are going to chop it and it
wants to keep glowing and so what's
going to happen it's going to explode
there let's see what it does you would
not want to build this circuit
okay let's put it let's put it
I don't know what's going to happen deal
with one cattle in this case
let's make that bigger
okay
you
okay now if we crank it up to a hundred
let's jeez this foot ten
and
well are you kidding me what is your
problem now let's see how much in what
is happening here
we are turning on oh we have a seven oh
it's we have to over turn the transistor
on at one we want it at point 6 volts it
turns on why do we have
is this an inverter one is
that's not where we want the output Oh
use your head
okay let's see here okay so when that
turns off its going to don't we want it
to uh it's going to go through this
shouldn't there be a big spike on this
fucker
what okay it's gonna flow through there
and then when it turns off it's going to
flow through there so that should
actually become a negative voltage or
yeah is that that make sense
something like that let's just crank
that fucker up I think if we make this
I'm pretty sure we get higher voltage
that's great definitely one mill ahead
and that's pretty big isn't it
oh look at that we got 12 volts we
started okay what is ours
what is our vote that what is our supply
voltage this is 1 volt Hey look at that
we got we got a missus ridiculous this
is the difference between an engineer
who has experience and an engineer who
doesn't
[Laughter]
okay oh shit I thought we're gonna get a
higher spike what if we give it more
time to get some current is it
saturating how much current is when we
throw the switch
Vega we're not throwing the switch fast
enough for one thing what if we what if
we turn this into a square wave would
that help I think it would help how hard
can that be why don't you have a fucking
square wave okay fuck
book
so is it
is the current is it saturating bullshit
okay well we got it we got it
it's silly
we got your 50 bolts okay and that's how
you get hand
yeah that was fun okay we had some
success
save copper
