so I didn't I didn't did I didn't send a
video to Diana before she left she left
somewhere no I could have if I had done
it right maybe it would have worked they
got the other hand I got the other hand
you think this hand automatically adapts
to the dynamics of what do you think
symmetrical there's this kitchen on the
first try this still with you personally
well okay well so I don't think it's
going to be pretty interesting to watch
mr. Carey play bayonet with raw okay
so war
oh are you thinking what I'm thinking
there's a schoolyard not in front of the
children
shit it's my price breathe okay
I don't know what that was hey let's I
don't know but you gotta think is
something new and clever because like
that's do you masturbate
what Olli it is Brock oh okay I fucked
it up didn't get first rank Oh Gary walk
oh did you see that
I almost got the bugger yeah oh do the
left hand you idiot you gotta switch
hands
you want your left hand good at aiming
right cuz it
what if you do you like your right hand

left him when you're not aiming it in
great what about the magic and the magic
aiming hand did you see with the left
hand I got some magic let's put the left
hand yeah your magic Andy oh okay so
whatever whatever the master
masturbatory I have gone to masturbatory
uh let's complete this bugger all right
one two three playing go tango okay fuck
you ready one two three three
okay can we here's the plan we're gonna
flick that fucker like that right pretty
okay fucking shit so we want miracles in
shit no no it's just this is the
Internet's full of this fucking shit so
ways I should probably go do some
physics because if you want physics girl
you probably need the piece no you don't
need to be missed you need to be the
best person that you were meant to be
and I think I should drum because fuck
yeah
let's play something like recognizable
hey hey we need to break another one oh
ho no no no no state leads down on that
okay can we fix it what if we make it
like like this is like our secret we get
some wax put some wax right there and

like this is not it's not morning after
we fix this skit in this evening is duct
tape foot yeah of course
that's again that's gonna look at it we
don't want to hide it on the other hand
