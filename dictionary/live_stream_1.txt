okay so it's not every day you do
something
this epic I'm about to do the most epic
thing in the history I'm about to do the
most epic thing in the okay here's
what we're gonna do we're gonna convert
the sound to 8 bits where you can
convert sound 8 bits is that fucking
crazy okay so you know what do we go to
sound directory I know where people
might be angry but fucking you know why
because we got the bomb okay so uh
because we got the bomb okay so note the
frequency where is that note
where is frequency
do you God said he wants 8-bit sound
note to frequency okay let's go ahead
and remove this from here escape okay
note to frequency okay so are you sure
just to double-check I wouldn't want to
get this incorrect I think I did it from
memory
that's hilarious okay
anyway I should probably use the octaves
of a piano okay 440 actives of a PI you
know is there a what do they call is
there an official octave for middle C
88-key piano okay so designation look at
that look at that look at that - will be
official what do you say people so we
have 256 to work with oh he said signed
he wants it fucking signed
holy fuck hahaha
a character oh my good heavens gracious
okay so we do it signed well there you
have it
is 88 gonna be okay what Oh God here
that means it'll go really really low
holy fuck that's what he wants
it's gonna be assigned okay that'll see
4:40 okay so metal C for middle C is for
a 440 okay so a 440 is octave for 440 is
octave for are you sure be absolutely
sure yes for forty is octave for okay
are you sure don't fuck this up Gav 440
is octave for okay so dear Lord okay 440
is octave for we should use a lookup
table okay so no to frequency
440 is octave for okay we got here
note the frequency 440 is high deform
okay so let's do this very carefully
okay so we are gonna have something
called a note and it's going to be an
8-bit signed value okay and we're going
to get rid of octave out of our stuff
okay so let's write a little you know
write some documentation people want to
know did you write documentation fuck no
I didn't write documentation did you
write a spec fuck no I didn't write a
spec what do you think I did I fucking
what are you nigger fuck you okay so no
to frequency okay how do we want to do
that just fucking do it
quit fucking around okay what do we call
these notes
there's octave and note and then there's
note we can invent a word for a or for a
sometimes it's good to invent a word
this is some wisdom I've learned if you
make oh if you make hello no no
what because it's impossible to use
github no it's public domain okay bye
okay so now let's see here what word
should we invent for note
- uh
a Touareg you want to use that word
that's what God said
- uh
this is it - uh okay but don't focus it
to it it's one of these you want to call
it a one up
one him to do it and the woman to do I
do
I wanna want it in they do it to us
okay so we call this at two up this is
an epic see okay - uh okay
so we say yeah - uh - frequency
I
- uh - frequency okay so we say - a - 3
+ note ok so all of my octaves are off
by one first I have to fix that let's go
slowly let's go a little bit slowly okay
so my octaves are holy fuck okay these
need to be active for okay
look frequency okay first control f
okay sound we'll go ahead and put this
in here
it doesn't really want to just do to us
in this okay let's put that back okay
put it back
merge D okay so we put these number two
okay so first of all we gotta fix the
octave we're off by one
okay so fuck okay let's see it where is
all that shit okay it's relax it's not
that much so we go to the sound
directory music
are gonna be it's just look for octave
magic ace okay
octave No
music sent octave
okay
he's accepted
okay
I do
octaves are entered of the digit
stations okay
tzedakah
no to frequency are different I give for
okay let's see if
no too frequently hey make sound sound
effect make sound files
there's no octaves in there draw CT
activity equals four no number in octave
- frequency okay and right here you also
want to use a - uh - frequency oh no no
no we're going to other direction we're
we're going a note to it - uh that's
what we want to do go to frequency
note
- - what
and we might as well call it an I hate
note number
okay
and this is none other and octave mine
is for
okay this is
octave times 12 plus note are you sure
okay this is a no-brainer
actually okay you want to call it a
wonder know what's called it to us you
want to call it a one it should be a one
a not a - up oh and a want to check for
that
let's go Google oh honey
looks good to me a 1-up why would you
why would you call it why would you call
it that to us it's a ona it's a one
at least it's a it's like octave a 1-up
octave times 12 plus nope
100 K and so let's look for note 2
frequency okay first we want to get rid
of all the octaves or fix all the
octaves okay so it should be okay note
to frequency what we want is that one up
to frequency note aunt one up enough
enough and then we want frequency
well that's kind of middle C is 12 times
for a 0 B 1 C 2 we're not gonna have a
default are you kidding me
okay so 48 plus 250 fitty okay oh wow
that's kind of fucking cool
you think they planned it okay now I say
so fiddy whatever do on that divided by
12 I'm confused
case is correct I'm then divided by 12
let's see let's just do it just do it
okay so note frequency I'm not different
just do it
okay fine okay now you know we know we
say no to freak machine we say one I'm
not on that to frequency and then we see
not frequency okay let's see if this
works now it should be off by a octave
okay okay so let's do this so let's
start me fuck you
oh no okay
note the frequency okay okay so now my
song should be off and I'm different
they should be an octave too low I could
do high that's one
okay now you know and now we we have to
change all the octaves are those being
set where are those being fucking sick
okay hold on a second
the do I do I set odd I don't set the
duct octave do I know I I just attacked
him okay
oh fuck okay so I've changed all these
songs not a problem okay we are
professional grade okay why are these
loop these are low and they're coming
out high I don't understand why are
these coming out high they should come
out low shouldn't they what the fuck
okay how about no hold on
octave for note 2 what do you eat
nope oh not well that's not correct
how'd that fucking happen
four times twelve Oh No octave okay oh
fuck did I screw that up okay maybe I've
gotten backward nope
why would they be backward they would
not be backward a note note to octave
for okay well this is obvious okay 50 so
under two frequency No - you octave four
so this is supposed to be metal scene
it's very high oh it's supposed to be oh
do you know how lucky I am
okay octave 4 is a this before 40 so
what the fuck seriously what the fuck
okay so I fucked something up okay so
for 40 is octave for no let's just get
this straight
middle C is something like 2 ad or
something
we correct
hold on a is 440 and its octave for
correct don't fuck this up okay
are they inverted up is up down is down
okay no I not didn't burn it okay well
good good it's messed up so 50 is middle
C and that that is wrong so let's fix it
50 divided by 12
how why is it wrong
it's way too big why is it way too big
let's just what are we looking at 50 you
suppose 48 is supposed to go to 440 okay
how are you gonna be what are we looking
at 2
- ^ its octave for 4 times X is that
what we're looking at its active for
something similar to this so
why are we multiplying by a 440 okay
4:40
if we take the natural log natural log
of one is zero
[Music]
oh the fuck am i doing let's just fuck
around with this till we get it right so
it's way too big why is it way too big
so let's see it's embarrassing okay
we're with that so we got 48 it goes to
440 if you go 12 up 36 goes to 2012 down
60 goes to 880 okay so therefore we're
looking at
oona divided by 12 why is it not just as
a 2 to the power on the / - oh is that a
fraction is that a decimal hold on a
second
is that integer Anna is an integer
divided by 12 point oh that converts
okay so what are we looking at - 2 to
the fourth
let's do it - to the fourth wait wait
wait
- to the fourth goes to three or fourth
goes to 440 so we have to divide by four
forty wait wait wait wait
- the fourth is a 16 divided by 4 40 so
multiplied by four forty divided by 16
okay let's just do this multiply it by
four forty weren't a divided by 16
that's kind of guts laughing at me oh
why don't we do it you want to know
subtract okay I guess so
when is 48
but that fucks it all up why are we
putting the sign there that's not what
it's supposed to be you want middle C is
going to be 0
I guess so well holy shit that's not
what I intended okay
you know anna is a is not like that okay
so somebody talked about the Fahrenheit
scale they were making fun of me they
thought that I was a dumb fuck
not capable of being the greatest man on
earth so they thought I was a fucking
Fahrenheit my god I'm not a fucking dumb
fuck fuck you okay so you know what we
do middle a is on on a zero okay so oh
yeah that's what it is
okay little C's
I give four
that's a lot what do you think you think
we should put this is kind of fucked up
no it's not fucked up I'll just change
that you idiot okay
so if we say -4 okay fuck just divide by
16 how hard can be let's just put that
there done I'm done on to the next one
what if we made no we're not gonna make
that's better so they're off an octave
and now we have to uh convert
okay so now we this is fun isn't it fun
this is fun okay so we're gonna write a
program to press to convert this song
you know what is
let's just do it just fucking do it
fuck okay so are we done no we have to
let's convert the music Oregon fine No
not very many people are in the god
league of human intelligence you have to
experience creating a new word before
you you start thinking like a god okay
so
now we we looked for somebody needs to
be changed is that the only thing I
think that's the only thing okay
somebody let's just change the octave I
think it's open okay let's go to the
Samedi did God mind right three
one two equals four Oh No
ought to be reformed
octave equals four
boy I really fucked that up didn't I why
didn't you check I don't know why I
didn't check because I was an asshole
okay
so I think we're good
okay is there anywhere else in the whole
operating system all the sounds have to
be changed that's not much of a problem
what do I have to do / - yeah that's all
I have to do is / - I do believe
okay so no no no that we're doing Una's
okay that's normal isn't it octave three
thank you no it's not normal what do we
need a new octave I think would you okay
fun yes we do need a new heart okay what
is your malfunction where do we set that
fucker how do we set that fucker
oh we do % D okay we have to look for a
% d % D here it is durations ok % d damn
it fine directory T we already draw no
we don't want drop mean draw controls
here we go yeah yeah no it's not part of
the controls jukeboxes no has nowhere
fuck you ok fine what are we looking for
we're looking for the menu where do we
sit the menu draw
well look for octave 9
we're always set menu is our fucking bin
directory f1 let's go look for media
let's inform any cement refined yes fuck
you
how do you said it fucking I forgot
menu entry find not a sub entry okay
there it is there it is okay octave % D
I looked for % T motherfucker
oh nevermind okay octave % D 0 to 6
okay we are now going hero to seven
and it is off and octave that's what it
should be less than or equal to seven
okay
just do it done I'm done the one to the
next one done on an iPhone
we don't have a zero anymore
don't have octave 0 1 to 7 it doesn't
that that note doesn't play but in the
future it might ok octave 0 we don't
have an active 0 but we do okay we're in
the God League the god League okay
zero to nine okay so that's handling
digits okay so what are we expecting is
it supposed to be off why is it off we
said no to frequency we're converting
the frequency it should be correct why
is it number two octave three at the
start it's are you fucking kidding me
so what
somebody find directory free
no it equals three
why was it three what books malfunction
oh we got that shit son okay so no I do
is that are you sure it's me it's all
MIDI it starts out octave three I can
swear octave three what is it that sets
that working for
when we draw it what are we drawing
octave honey swear me
it's right there I liked it Mindy makes
really fine I do check the truth
PS am sit active okay fine
yes and sit finally they're just fucking
around some bitch
PSM octave
PSM menu fine PSM
PSM octave or is it a default coming
into
okay we're going to use a mini yes I
want it okay
PSM I do
did we fucking sit that motherfucker
Wow I could swear how did I miss that I
did a very careful so that scares me
whenever I missed something it scares me
let's do it
excuse me when I miss things okay
where is that anyway we're good
right there there it is okay so no so it
should be often Achtung
no no that's correct okay we have octave
one doesn't work do we want an octave
zero okay now we we are we done no or no
you know the next step we have to
convert all the songs okay
so we have to write a sound a song
converter so do we want to Lex
the problem with lexing is it gets rid
of comments and it reformats it so we
don't really want to Lex it what if we
look for string constants and change
numbers inside a string constants I
think that might be our best bet will
that have any side effects on a song if
we look for a number inside of a string
and add one to it
oh oh we have an additional problem oh
is that true no it's not a problem okay
so now we want to look for numbers
inside the strings and add one okay
fuck at least it doesn't change the so
we go to templates this is a document
template okay copy
let's go to home and you might as well
convert song okay
what is your footing brown bird song
gate control F my util convert songs
how about convert you know convert song
okay replace oh okay so now
we want to look for a string being
converted okay well we can do it you
want to see
[Music]
24 per octave that's a good idea maybe
so half note
no we're gonna go with 12
middle C is to 61-62 let's check that
out % 0.6
Oh
I wanted to honor wanna
ahna 50
Mel C kidding me middle C is 260 1.6 -
shit
the other answer oh my god I almost
fucked it up Jesus Christ okay it was
correct hold on a second here
50 we have it set to high whoa okay hold
on a second here
whoa thank you I almost fucked it up
- twelve is uh fifty minus twelve is 38
wait a second here
2004 wait why are you seeing for weight
let's do zero before for 40 okay so this
is middle a middle C is you're saying
it's 261 that's deeper a a is deeper
you're not correct this is middle a are
you saying that's low lower a than
middle C fuck there's that 440 is active
for oh maybe it's just my middle C
that's off so octave 3 note C is 0 is a
Oh a B or a okay well we got to do the C
be ok a is zero zero one zero one two
three oh it's three okay
so middle c is octave three
okay middle C is active three but our
octaves are off
okay so 440 is active for are we correct
for 40s active for
440 is octave for I think you'd swear we
we covered this
for four days active for but middle C is
we need a fucking singing
what the fuck is this shit
a socket for
oh my god you gotta be kidding me
these guys are fuckin Fahrenheit
Fahrenheit niggers Jesus Christ look at
this shit are you kidding me
the sea is the start of the octave
instead of a what kind of retard nigger
came up with that
so I should we fix it okay I should
convert it correctly because my songs
are all broken so I had to do this
anyway my songs are all broken okay
fuck
I made all my songs I made all my
software there is no DRM fucking nigger
I'm gonna ban that fucker
fuck you
this evil God
okay so do we want to fix music or do we
want
okay
so the UH knot is correct so the enough
for the owner / 16 hold on a second here
sink thank you for thank you for finding
okay
so
nope - Ana okay
we want to add we want to subtract to
off okay it has to get fixed here that's
all we have to do so if if if if if if
nope okay nope it's less so yeah a let's
look at this a b c a a sharp B C C sharp
okay so if
middle C is active for did we see and
440 is octave 3 440 is a octave 3
let's just let's get that right okay so
middle C is octave for
as I know that you said it was too
little see is to middle C is to 61
middle C is octave for and middle a
octave for a is 440 okay
that's fucked up okay so it'll C is
active for
so a is zero a sharp is 1 B is 2 C is 3
C sharp is 4 so if note is
less than three
I could I almost fixed music I almost
fixed the music industry you niggers
okay
fucking retard nature's okay so so if
nope it's less than three we take octave
times 12 plus note
we take octave - one
octave for
okay
did I do this correctly I can't think
I'm sorry I can't they okay notice less
than three
plus one that's what we okay
it's pretty good okay so we say we say
percent
12:26 F on the tip frequency why did you
put the note order backward
I guess it's forward okay is there a
default on that let's not have a little
C is octave for okay
enough so octave four is middle C so
nope nope zero octave for this is
supposed to be 440 why are you fucking
shitting me
oh I fucked that up
okay so we have to do
is it
it's too high
try again okay
little C is active for so middle C is
12
Oh
I'm confused fucking I can't think hit
12.6 out come on
one extra frequency no note a octave for
oh my god
I'm feeling pretty embarrassed
okay 4:40
okay so middle C is octave for note 3
261 okay now we have it correct okay so
now we just have to rate the conversion
and everything will be wonderful let's
see if everything still works
oh this is fucked up figures oh damn
that is fucked up oh my god is that
fucked up what oh Lord
dear Lord
so we're all those notes okay doesn't
look too bad
so what just happened eh oh this is a
there it's not note a by the way so so
what are we looking at middle C is H is
C okay so H is C like that's not too bad
H is C so that means where's 8 years h h
is see that's why don't we why are we
doing this
zero okay H is C
HSC how many of those did we have not
very many
okay these are not an octave up
is that all there is are you sure okay
so
[Music]
good it works
[Music]
[Music]
how come that's correct does that
convert it to the letters or something
what about this is this fucked up
this is fucked up isn't it dammit this
is this is fucked up I'm sure it is
of course it's fucked up what did you
think of course it's fucked up
shit okay okay so this is okay but the
notes are fucked okay so
let's convert him to Una's and then
okay so
nope
let's look for octave octave magic keys
set octave okay that's not wrong
I do
recalc XY okay so now we want to convert
these to it on up
okay since we have an honor
why don't we convert it to it what do
you think people
okay no I don't feel like doing that so
if note
did I do
if not-it's less than zero note equals
11
okay this is fucked up this needs to be
if note is less than three oh shit
so fucking nigger design this
was he German that made the piano jesus
fucking christ
how hard can it be a is the fucking
beginning fucking starts on see
you want to convert these to an enough
okay
[Music]
of course we should convert it to Ana
that's the glory of Donna where do we
want to convert him to Ana that's the
question okay
we want to convert from not okay we need
to write okay now we have to do the
other direction
on earth anata o unintuitive
okay this
I'm interactive
Oh
you think I should tell computer science
people
they'll just have to find out the hard
way
okay so we say
oh we have a we have a division for this
you know that there's a math routine
mod there's a mod I could swear we have
a mod for this mod 60 mod to you 64
give in return ECT form
quotient
okay well why do you 64
nope
equals five you 64 address 12 and what
do we say if no it's less than three
returned
let's see
what about sind
if it's negative sake enough fuck it up
we do want negative why don't you just
do that
how hard can it be
what does mental see no - okay sure
460
fifty-one
okay middle C is 51 a a sharp you see
zero one two three why didn't they make
it fifty Jesus Christ oh never mind
middle C is 51 okay they started at 1
instead of 0 you know what no they
started what little C is 51 okay okay
do we do in our documentation do we do
single-spaced yes do single-spaced
under frequency
okay let's see if we got this correct
okay so let's see nope
note three octave four is not less than
three no
wait is note less than 3
note three octave for three it's 36
I know see his note as active form okay
note 3 is 4 times 12
51 okay 51 modulo 12 is 3 know
three-octave
51 divided by 12 is 4 is no less than 3
no so it's 4
so what what is 440 is
what is that that is middle a is 440 its
up higher isn't it yeah okay okay so we
say
so okay
now you see
what are you doing okay so three
okay so okay looks good no
little a
okay so we got it correct now let's go
ahead let's see about our music is this
under sound we don't have music sound
run it to frequency
why don't I say midsi do you want to
replace metal in the whole operating
system okay
okay now we go to the glossary and we
make an abbreviation entry every time
you use an abbreviation you have to
register it one time I thought this was
bad and not good anyway H mg mg s quick
okay okay let's go to sound know the
owner metal see is on a 51
why don't we say fuck
our notation is a little bit sloppy
because a note is kind of sloppy but it
is sloppy so at least it's better with
it enough okay
I think we're saying okay so let's see
what's here
[Music]
okay so
so
and all we have to do change these to us
as soon as possible so let's find the
octaves let's do that
that'll be a clue fine okay this becomes
an enough want to change all these to
honest
just fucking do it just fucking do it
what's up Tempe in Tempe in is a note
okay
no documents
I guess we teach all these too honest
no let's not JC's Donna's because people
know
fucked up shit okay
would this be improved if I changed all
these to honest no actually as a matter
of fact and unof is an absolute value
not a it's not a a note is actually
relative
so as a matter of fact I have a good
excuse not to change those to Una's so
do you want to change him to honest
okay so the XY
we need to change list
the y-value its
if note is less than three
oh wait let's make this an honor okay
if it is not a meter then we're not
equals
octave okay what about we have to do
modulo hold on a second here okay
like to rest that's zero I do believe is
it not I think so
I mean I holy fucking shit
okay wrong answer
why is it negative sharp is lower what
the fuck what is your malfunction
sharp is lower what the fuck sir should
be higher what the fuck is this shit
flat
this could be oh well maybe it is we're
talking about who knows what this is
okay
okay we already took care of that one up
oh we have to go plus or minus
I think we just do the why don't we the
fuck is this no map
what the fuck is athis I think we just
do the honor knowing what does no twerp
Oh
Sawadee fine director note ma'am okay
a sharpie
okay
okay so up and down is inverted sharp
you want your Y to go up flatten you
wanted Y to go down
and this is here we can get rid of that
why are you figuring out this fucking
note shit
measure National Lab
Thanks
okay
why are you figuring out note is there
only four why that's all you're doing
I'm gonna so I think we want to do the
UNA times
octave times 7 minus 2 I think we just
want other times 1 that times 4 okay
what do we got okay
it's inverted for one thing so if it's
inverted let's put this back the other
way
put this back the other way and it's
invert just fucking do it okay so so a
is note 6 note 6 octave 3 so we want to
octave times 7
Oh
it's harder than I thought is it and we
do need to note in the other one don't
we okay so
okay let's go ahead and
okay
- well
hey that's not correct anymore because
the notes are scuffed up the note the
note map is no good
let's see where the note map is used
okay fine
okay so we have another one of these oh
dear Lord we have a lot to fix
okay
I don't want to be on television anymore
I don't
you
