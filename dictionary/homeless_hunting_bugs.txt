okay so I'm gonna go chase that bug that
I was chasing earlier um I am at home in
my van
this is my my new home I need a pillow
okay without further ado oh shit oh shit
okay so so we're chasing a bug so when
when you put print statements and oh
someone someone fixed it someone said
they fixed it
let's go see what they did
someone said they fixed a bug well
aren't you clever
so we've got a is a a seat pal
so we have to the only way that to mount
it is uh okay let's see what they got so
how are we gonna do this
so go
file
oh shit shut down shut down it's hot in
here
file Mountain virtual disk password
okay
and
well I always okay but TOS is the O and
oz like okay
we always mount the D partition for
transfers and on my VM disk okay so I'm
out and let's go ahead and CD don't just
don't like her
I'm a little bit uncomfortable so pseudo
CP me SS star /mnt fish BM disc
okay it worked so now we uh
file
okay and I'm not closed now we start
this puppy up
let's see what that person provided me
with
so I'm gonna go ahead and maximize yeah
VMware you always have to resize it okay
so if we go control m to the D Drive and
CD
so I don't think it was mounting with
the foot let's see if it moves
it mounted okay I have a sponge in there
let's see if I say find sponge
that's my new way of labeling it yeah
look at that
no no no no fuck I have when a doctor
does surgery he has to count the number
of sponges they left inside according to
mash do you know mash anyway what the
truck maybe I didn't recompile
okay anyway so it's mounted so we go so
now we had now I needed to do a diff
let's see what he's got on there huh
their report Red chief reading foul read
essentials so Drive
I haven't really done this in a while oh
you should wise got fancy alright
lower the centrioles okay chair to load
a binary
Wow
I just been doing some work he doesn't
sound like he'd fix the Red Sea
maybe his this is an alternative to the
Red Sea
okay well that's I got an email saying
he fixed it I think he's just showing
off his network stuff Oh what the heck I
think I know this is this from Alec
Murphy
hello
[Laughter]
I sort of concealed the way to make
binary files he figured it out I think I
told him that tell him what's it gonna
be
what you gonna do what if it corrupts my
master copy I trust
whoa look at that
well I'll leave that
yeah
snake
Wow he's very professional cool
so you say gonna fix my
so I hope it's just um I hope I just
introduced a bug that would be the maybe
it's simple you know maybe I just
introduced a buck nothing more than that
I I thought that uh Hugh EMU was not
supporting red seat all of a sudden I
it's bad when you suspect other people
of your bugs anyway
okay so is this crashes it's in
how did I forgot what I did in an
earlier episode hidden black device and
it wasn't it fuck I'm rusty
okay so hey there's that welcome I said
I search for sponge what the fuck I said
find sponge what the fuck
Oh
[Music]
find sponge
there we go okay so the surgeon has to
count the number of sponges so okay so
it's printing not read see I so final
read it's probably not valid then as
prote it is so for some reason maybe I
have some uninitialized values or
something I don't know
read see validate let's go into Ritchie
validate okay we can get rid of I think
max blocks was looking good I think red
see validate is the question is is it
correct
this is invalid or is it
okay so later to drive luck read read
see mr. B
[Music]
okay let's I got a six going
well it's not ready to read it
okay now okay so they'll put this
difference between good programmer and a
bad programmer he's not lazy Oh No
well I wanted one difference okay steep
quick wham bam thank you ma'am
beep okay let's go there
d
shut up moduli yeah kay it's months
puppy
Sixers hey look at that damn I'm good
damn I'm kid okay so Sixers in size okay
find
hey where's max - max black still there
what the fuck I can remove that fucker
the fuck is it trips me out why does it
there what what the fuck
oh it's on the D Drive okay you gotta go
to this C Drive fine okay so I can swear
I got rid of that they just not didn't
save it nests right okay so the max
blocks we're being a little bit quick in
her judgment let's print the signature
just to be sure
just to make sure what is and and
sectors you go sighs sick there's equal
size what did we get we got something
great
okay let's let's see where DB size gets
initialized DB size is equal to nothing
okay we got an it partition let's just
go to Colonel black do
control-f sickness size
yeah
find directory size equals okay besides
see you there's where you knit it equals
sectors
how could it get different okay so did
would you double do red see in it of
course we did how do we know what did
that
okay which one let's look let's print
this out how about that control insert
shift
okay do it
hurry up we're on the time clock
actually we're okay
don't have a very comfortable seat
it never hits them it that's weird
validates it myself it's not valid
validates it later doesn't it why is it
not valid what if this was created wrong
what if it was created wrong
okay so fuck hey let's just override
that get rid of it what's that gonna do
it's off by 8:00 it's off by 8:00 where
does that ring a bell
fuck eight times
what if those created rung let's
good-looking huh
so then it didn't do normally gonna
drive see
[Music]
[Music]
what they should do that
don't worry
so
okay let's see so maybe my ritzy is
being created wrong size
let's play that one what was the size of
the file how about that one of them is
the size of the file okay so uh zero
aches
control
okay we wanna divide this by 512 that
you would get
+5 later
this is never a wash
okay the file I think you got ahead 80 y
no - 80 - 80 fuck you
so
okay well
so
the ISO has some header blocks
let's see
[Applause]
well yes I got a good look so I'm gonna
go let's go to get the difference
between a good programmer the bad
programmer not lazy
what something like that hey okay so
let's look for size
I could swear my f3 is not working what
the fuck's up with that
there has functioned weird
yeah like that
thank you
okay so so there's a there's an overhead
for a cd-rom and then there's the Red
Sea filesystem
we're getting in discrepancy what if I
knew well it's just that's not a good
test I could get rid of the let's just
try this this is a bad idea
fine
so right here we cannot
okay
so we're just gonna ignored the check
okay
now I'm comfortable
I haven't programmed in a long time
okay you knit that's pretty crazy
13:04 so what if I try to install oh you
want to install it's probably fucked up
at the end isn't it
why did it all of a sudden start
happening around fuck maybe the size
changed
and it started happening okay so uh well
but a memory what do we get
okay so CD I was trying to do the file
manager
okay DRV maybe it's corrupt in this way
okay
so decide
let's go listen to some hymns but a
memory
oh my god
this three cake
okay so
it's not very happy
something's fucked up
look into the world
Colonel hacking okay so fine
okay so I guess why don't you not be
lazy and do it bit by bit
fuck because I want to be lazy so either
the either the file was created wrong or
now it doesn't do them it validates it
before it initializes that makes sense
the validation is off
okay
rid civility which look for that
read fuck it right there size is equal
to max' black plus 1 dairy offset
what if the sectors per cluster is no
there's no sickness per cluster max
block secretive directory entry size /
block size
it's not off by one it's off by a lot
what is it biddy
these sectors
what does photon wise before
leaning on my pad gotta get used to
notebook
ramdisk that's not the problem
you know the tapi is wrong too
let's worry about this first
so when you format you set the block to
my sectors okay this is super rich
okay
TV says
trash
oh you know what I think its rounded up
where did we allocate the motherfucker
wait a minute
TV size
sector skills from TV size
Moonves
- Drive offset that's where just so the
drive offset let's print the drive
offset how about that
so far read
here it's printed reserves it
this is the 80 blocks header that she
have on a cd-rom
motherfucker I hate when the cursor
jumps that's what I don't like about
laptops one thing
okay prett drive us it
robust 58 hex
you're gonna get rid of me
it's too big
what
so somebody likes debuggers
well
good luck
so how would you use a debugger okay so
58
so the
50 is 80
58
he
fuck you
[Music]
buuut block
max watch
well shit
of any let's dump to boot right now
let's dump the Moo trigger that was that
[Music]
okay so
oh yeah
glass red
Oh
break
okay so what if I print Br
you just want to make it extra for us
this way
you get fancy but there's simply
so we're gonna we're gonna add this
we're gonna add this to the colonel
as an extra
so now you're too
this is a pretty tricky punch
temporarily
the extra now it's a report
this is where we have import rate
okay so now we go
okay
so
sectors
[Music]
Plus aimed in two blocks
they're off by 8
it's a cd-rom it's rounded to a four in
four is it
file size CD ROMs running to a four
you don't have any me
